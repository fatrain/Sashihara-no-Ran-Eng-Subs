1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:01,999
The show has started.

2
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:04,065
Yeah, I'm happy.

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:07,332
-You've been saying you wanted to do it.
-Right, I am very happy.

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,865
-You've been saying it.
-About the show.

5
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:13,465
-At first this show was more likely to be on DVD.
-DVD?

6
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,332
-You wanted to make something casual on DVD.
-Ah, right.

7
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,532
-Who would have thought, it'll become a TV show?
-Incredible!

8
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,265
Being first is something else.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,399
Yeah... looks like it makes things go smoother.

10
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:30,332
-This is what we've been discussing from the start.
-Yes.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
-Even before you've become 1st.
-Right.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
-Who would have thought, that you'll become 1st.
-That's for sure.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,500
So the preparations for the new
regular show have started since then?

14
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:47,065
No. On the contrary, two of my shows have ended.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,932
Long story short, you've discussed with the staff

16
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,599
the implementation of your idea once again.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,332
-And you decided to do it.
-Yes.

18
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:06,999
So? Have you found something you want to do?

19
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,332
Yeah, I've thought about it.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,465
I want to release a photo collection.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,232
-Photo collection?
-Yes.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,999
Well, you know... Photo collection is something, that is fun to look at...

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
-You know... boobs...
-I understand, what you're trying to say.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Should we do a boob job first on this show then?

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,590
Sashihara's Rebellion
(handwritten by Sashihara Rino)

26
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,730
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,980
to challenge several projects, 
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

28
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,532
Didn't you already have a photo collection?

29
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,532
It was a photo book.

30
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,399
That was a photo book?

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,332
Yes, mainly consists of text.

32
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,865
40% of photos, 60% of text.

33
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:07,999
So this time you don't need to part of the "book"?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,399
Yes, no book.

35
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,399
So no book?

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,599
No book, photos only.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,432
-That's the plan?
-Yes.

38
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:19,932
I think it's a thing that can be released only when I am in my 20's.

39
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,265
It should be now.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,265
Should it be now?

41
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,932
Well, there are things, that have expiration date.

42
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:34,999
As long as there are people who will help me, this kind of shows could be made in the future regardless of my age,

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,465
but photo collection is something I have to make now.

44
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,065
In the future, when I have kids,

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,265
I'll have nothing to show them from the times I was 1st.

46
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:52,132
But you have a "Fortune Cookie" PV.

47
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,265
I want to release a photo collection.

48
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,132
Is there a reason?

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,399
I am on salary,

50
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,532
so that will help me quite a bit.

51
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,799
-"Ohta Pro" has a salary system?
-Yes.

52
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:08,132
-So it's about money?
-Not only.

53
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,932
-Money?
-Isn't everything.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,799
Wait a second, when you start talk about photo collection, there is one important thing coming to my mind right away...

55
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,999
I don't know...

56
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,399
How should I put it...

57
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:28,265
There is probably a reason, why you haven't released it yet, right?

58
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,699
That is...

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,332
Well, you know, photo collections are...

61
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,865
With popularity like yours,

62
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,799
it's only natural for photo collection offers to come.

63
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:49,199
They could have talked with Akimoto-san about it.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,665
How should I put it...

65
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,920
Why do you make such big deal out of it?

66
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,599
Just spit it out already.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,265
Well, you know...

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,780
Then, nothing to hold off

69
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,132
I think photo collections

70
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,800
are about looks...

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,332
You have a point there.

72
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,265
It's important.

73
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:14,132
Because mostly men buy them, right?

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,665
Yeah.

75
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,532
But think about it...

76
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:22,065
I am somewhat popular right now.

77
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:26,132
If I won't release it now, nobody will buy it later.

78
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,960
But...

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,599
You have to consider, what your fans seek from you.

80
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,665
I think the reason of your popularity

81
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,199
is because you're funny.

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,132
But your face is...

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,065
-well... so-so...
-Yes.

84
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,532
-And breast...
-The festival is sure loud!

85
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,999
The festival outside is loud!

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,999
It's adding grace to this program's opening.

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,132
When I try to proceed with this unpleasant talk,

88
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:09,399
-it feels like they're cheering me on.
-Go on, go on!

89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,865
They are supporting me.

90
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,665
Frankly speaking, Sasshi in swimsuit is not in demand.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,465
True.

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
Right, that's not the most pleasant view.

93
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,732
It's true, that you are famous for your beautiful legs,

94
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:31,599
but when I sometimes look at your upper body gravure photos,

95
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,465
unfortunately your breasts are quite... unsightly.

96
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,799
But, do you think that you're the most beautiful right now?

97
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:42,065
If we do this later, a lot of post editing will be needed.

98
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,632
Your looks?

99
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:46,199
I don't spend money on my looks.

100
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,199
I think I could have preserved my skin in the current state for the next photo collection,

101
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,799
but I don't have such plans.

102
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,332
-You don't invest in your looks?
-No.

103
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,000
I am planning to live without plastic surgeries.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,465
You've been suspected of one though.

105
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,666
I seriously couldn't understand it!
I don't have time for it!

106
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:08,190
I was surprised myself! When I heard the news,
I was filming

107
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,970
TV Tokyo drama at Yamagata.

108
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,199
They suspected you've done plastic surgery,

109
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:15,799
but when I saw you, you looked even worse than before...

110
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:21,065
That's true! I just transferred
at that time, my face was swollen.

111
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,265
I gained some weight.

112
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,390
I was suspected of plastic surgery,
just because my face was swollen.

113
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:30,732
So people always say you've been going on in this business while being an ugly...

114
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:34,199
What the heck is this "going on in this business while being ugly"? Could you just stop it?

115
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,866
So you're just not obsessed with becoming cute?

116
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,265
Yeah, something like that.

117
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:44,399
So what kind of photo collection are you planning to make?

118
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,820
Do you have some role model in mind?

119
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,532
If we'll really release a photo collection,

120
00:06:54,466 --> 00:07:00,332
various people will say, that the idea and implementation for it

121
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,465
was born in this show.

122
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:05,999
"Santa Fe".

123
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,665
-You want it like "Santa Fe"?
-"Santa Fe".
*note: "Santa Fe" is a Japanese nude photo book

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,132
Santa Fe is a name of place.

125
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,465
Is that so? "Santa Fe".

126
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,465
If I go nude, I am sure there will be people willing to buy it.

127
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,465
I wonder about that...

128
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,760
[New show "Sashihara's Rebellion"
goes just like this]

129
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:28,000
But when will this show be broadcasted?

130
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:29,332
At what time?

131
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,280
-October?
-The start is on the 9th of October.

132
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,999
At 2:05 a.m.

133
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,132
-That so late at night!
-Who will watch it?

134
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,799
I want to thank each one, who'll watch it, seriously.

135
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,732
I'll do gratitude home visits,

136
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,599
to those, who'll watch it.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,332
I don't remember watching such late shows.

138
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,532
You're right...

139
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,399
But you know...

140
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,732
It's TV Tokyo.

141
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,865
At TV Tokyo and 2 a.m

142
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,466
you can do anything.

143
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,000
-Is that so?
-Yes.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,999
TV Tokyo will still broadcast anime even if all other channels are broadcasting news.

145
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:13,365
Yeah, that's right, that's TV Tokyo. TV Tokyo doesn't give a damn about show contents after 0:00.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,999
We're talking vulgarly right now,

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,732
but there is this regular evening show... How was it called?

148
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,665
"Ladies 4"?

149
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,532
No!

150
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,332
A kid's show.

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,332
Something-san...

152
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:31,632
"Piramekino"! Let's make "Sashiharano"!

153
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,865
Let's make a show for kids.

154
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:37,199
Rename "Sashihara no Ran" to "Sashiharano"?

155
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:42,732
Because it's as late as 2 a.m. and vulgar, no one will watch it.

156
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,732
Let's make them watch.

157
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,732
Personally I am happy even for this late night slot,

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,599
but my fans are...

159
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,399
A lot of my fans are

160
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,670
in their 60's,

161
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:59,999
so they will probably sleep at that time.

162
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,865
They can record it.

163
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,865
It's easy nowadays.

164
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,160
My fans bring their grandchildren to handshake events.

165
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,530
I think viewership rating won't be more than 0.8%.

166
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,065
That's bad. I can't lose to "Ariyoshi AKB".

167
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,799
By the way,

168
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,340
isn't this company great?

169
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,880
I feel they have a lot of money.

170
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,532
This company?

171
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,399
-Which produces this show?
-Yes.

172
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,665
Their lunch was awesome.

173
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:32,032
This company is called "East Entertainment".
They made shows like "Kiseki Taiken Unbelievable".

174
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:35,865
One of many.

175
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,133
Another one is "Heisei Kyouiku Gakuin".

176
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,133
-I performed in that Yusuke Santamaria's quiz show!
-It has ended though.

177
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,999
Please listen to this!

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,999
They even have spiral staircase!

179
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,199
That's probably

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,265
a spiral staircase to "Heisei Kyouiku Iinkai" show.

181
00:09:52,933 --> 00:10:02,265
When you step out from elevator and go to meeting room,
there is a monitor with a list of all meetings.

182
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:03,265
Mind-blowing.

183
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:04,532
Isn't it?

184
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:08,465
Then let's build a "Sashihara's Rebellion" building.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,065
-You are right.
-You can do it, "East"!

186
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,599
By the way, how many votes did you get at General Elections?

187
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,599
150?..

188
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,230
-150k, I guess.
-Around 150 thousands?

189
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,599
Those were from your fans only?

190
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,399
-I wonder...
-Or from HKT fans too?

191
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,599
I am sure from HKT fans too.

192
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:38,065
I wonder, if they'll buy your photo collection?

193
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:44,465
What does it mean?

194
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,865
Probably 10 people will.

195
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,265
10?!

196
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,865
I don't know,

197
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,932
but my photo book

198
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,799
was pretty popular.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,990
Is Sashihara's photo collection going to sell good?

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,865
But you know, my fans are very tolerant.

201
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:04,065
Yeah, they are liberal.

202
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:08,399
They never get mad, when you speak evil about me.

203
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,199
They even laugh out loud together.

204
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,265
I am not sure,

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,065
If only your fans will buy this collection,

206
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,065
the publisher probably won't accept the offer.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,899
We'll manage somehow,
if bookstores would make flashy signboards.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,800
You are right. It's bookstores' business to sell.

209
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,280
Even Naoki Hyakuta cooperates with bookstores.

210
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,265
Who is that?

211
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,050
-An author of "Eien no Zero" best selling novel.
-Ah, I see.

212
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:47,132
He goes to bookstores and checks where his books are placed.

213
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,899
That's it!

214
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,799
Let's ask for signboards.

215
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:57,332
Well, since you've requested to make a photo collection,

216
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,130
we have to do it.

217
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,332
Let's do it!

218
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,210
Let's make someone to make it!

219
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:09,000
-Do you know someone in this business, who likes you?
-Who likes me?

220
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,132
We'll use his connections

221
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,665
-Let me think about it.
-...for this show's advantage.

222
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,266
Fukuda-san!

223
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:21,199
Only me?!

224
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:22,465
I see.

225
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,932
I don't have power in this industry.

226
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:29,732
You're the only one who supports me.
I am really grateful for that.

227
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,832
Really.

228
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:31,732
I don't.

229
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,865
Yes you do.

230
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,132
Thank you very much!

231
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,599
I wish I had more power.

232
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,465
This show could've been broadcasted earlier.

233
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,999
But someone came into my mind...

234
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:46,265
Once in a show called "AKBINGO"...

235
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,632
In this show...

236
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:51,199
Before General Elections...

237
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,599
About a week before General Elections in episodes 240-241...

238
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,399
-I made predictions.
-Ah, right, I remember!

239
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,532
-Why?
-Beats me.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,332
I was called.

241
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:09,132
I had nothing else to do, so I appeared in that show.

242
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,399
And in a dressing room

243
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,865
a person next to me was

244
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:16,732
Aoki-san.

245
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:17,932
Ah, "Koubunsha" publisher!

246
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,565
-You know him?
-Of course.

247
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,999
-We eat together often.
-So you are close?

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,260
Yeah, we get a long really well.

249
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,499
I call him Milky.

250
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,599
Milky?

251
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,532
Because he likes Milky,

252
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,459
I call him that.

253
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:30,499
So he likes her?

254
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:34,132
When AKB staff dine together Aoki-san participates too.

255
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,466
I see.

256
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,965
So you know him well?

257
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:47,119
Mr. Aoki (Koubunsha)
Entertainment editorial department, Editor-in-Chief.
Eats with Sashihara quite often.
Seems like a fan of Watanabe Miyuki, NMB48

258
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,060
Then let's ask Aoki-san.

259
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:54,732
It's useless to ask him.

260
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,665
Why?

261
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,799
His eyes don't smile.

262
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,399
Say again.

263
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:08,532
He is frequently teased by everyone. Like called Aoky and Milky...

264
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,932
Even though he is teased,

265
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:14,665
I think he lets others to tease him on purpose.

266
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,465
How should I explain it?

267
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:21,999
He laughs, when being teased, to get along
with everyone, but his eyes are cold.

268
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,665
-Is that so?
-So he won't be tricked.

269
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,900
-Only business?
-He'll deal only with successful projects.

270
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,399
He must be very smart.

271
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,265
He was an editor-in-chief of "Flash",

272
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:35,199
so he must be very sharp!

273
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,865
That's why I think, he won't participate,
if there won't be 100% profit.

274
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:45,065
But we don't have other options.
"Koubunsha" releases a lot of AKB photo books and collections, right?

275
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,360
True.

276
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:50,465
Yuko-chan, Rena, Milky, Acchan...

277
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:52,799
Their photo collections.

278
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,150
Milky probably tricked him.

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,232
Tricked?

280
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,660
You were tricked by her "Please make it" as well.

281
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,865
-Right!
-No wonder!

282
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,199
I was completely tricked.

283
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:07,599
She probably asked Aoki "Make it happen, please" and he agreed like "isn't that good?".

284
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,065
She completely tricked me in "Child Machine" show.

285
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,332
She neared my face

286
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,132
at about 50 cm distance

287
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,732
She looked up into my eyes and asked:

288
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,450
"Why I don't have a personal corner in the show?"

289
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,065
"I really want one, really".

290
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:35,799
-"Why?"
-And I am like: "I really want to do one too", immediately.

291
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,865
This is insane!

292
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,699
Well, I'd do the same, since she's cute.

293
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,832
I was tricked.

294
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:47,599
I'll also ask like her: "Please release my photo collection".

295
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,199
That's not cute at all.

296
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,699
Please make it.

297
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:56,799
-So let's rely on her...
-Let's extort him with Milky.

298
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,830
Right.

299
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,970
But you have to know, that "Dentsu" is behind this show.

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,199
What is "Dentsu"?

301
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,516
"Dentsu Inc." is...
[Dentsu: a major advertising agency]

302
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:06,430
a company, who claimed "We drive our society"

303
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,650
in times of economic bubble of 80's.

304
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,200
Does it drive now?

305
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,865
Not so much now.

306
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,999
So let's try calling Aoki-san.

307
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,165
Let's!

308
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
-To Koubunsha's...
-...Aoki.

309
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:25,465
Basically, we have to make
arrangements with people in this show.

310
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,580
I see.

311
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,532
I don't know how it goes, though.

312
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:29,733
So, let's get going.

313
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:30,799
Yes!

314
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,999
I got in touch with Aoki-san.

315
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,032
-Really? I am glad.
-Yes.

316
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,399
He is in office right now.

317
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,866
"Let's fight! Let's smoke him out!"

318
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:51,799
-You haven't seen this drama yet?
-No, I don't watch dramas.

319
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,132
-You haven't seen "Hanzawa Naoki"?
-Nope.

320
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,599
"It's payback time!"

321
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:58,865
Nor have I seen "Amachan",

322
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,265
but it's so popular, that I had to remember the song from it.

323
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,599
-"Hanzawa Naoki" had a rating of 40%!
-That's insane!

324
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,999
Almost half of nation saw it.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,132
Mind-blowing.

326
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,465
And you know nothing except  "payback"?

327
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,000
"Payback! Double payback!"

328
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,200
-In the end it was 100 times, right?
-Yeah.

329
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,465
Then I know about unexpected betrayal.

330
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,399
Do you know the plot?

331
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,000
Something about...

332
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,399
the troubles in bank.

333
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:26,999
-So you know?
-Yes.

334
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,665
-That's right.
-Even though I haven't watched it.

335
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,932
I wanted to watch it, because everyone liked it.

336
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:34,732
But everyone watched it from the start.

337
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,532
How could they predict it?

338
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,265
-You can't tell, it's going to be good from title.
-Right.

339
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,065
But everyone watched it...

340
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,532
Ah, my agency...

341
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,499
"Ohta Pro".

342
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,632
Close by.

343
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,599
Nice.

344
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,932
I hope this show continues to be this carefree.

345
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,799
Noticed agency and said it.

346
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,665
Yotsuya, 3rd block.

347
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,865
That's right, it Yotsuya.

348
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:04,932
By the way, about the opening talk just now...

349
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,999
I have sad news.

350
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,865
50% of it won't be used.

351
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:16,399
But not just 50%,

352
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,132
more like 70%.

353
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,799
Sashihara-san's faint mode.

354
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,199
I am imitating "Aruaru Expedition" gag

355
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,665
of comedian duo "Regular".

356
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:29,132
-We talked so much and 70% of it will be cut.
-Ridiculous!

357
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,932
On the contrary, what will be used?!

358
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,399
Seriously.

359
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,865
I'll pay them back! Seriously!

360
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,266
What are we going to do?

361
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:42,199
If we'll release a DVD with that stuff, it'll sell like crazy.

362
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,265
It'll be a bomb.

363
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,065
A bomb.

364
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,065
It's so sad to let that money go.

365
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,265
Just don't use those parts about my seniors.

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,265
-But juniors are OK?
-OK.

367
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,333
Are they?

368
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,333
I don't mind.

369
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,199
It's OK to talk about my juniors.

370
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:02,265
In this show, even if you know,

371
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,999
-that it won't be used, we still say it.
-Right.

372
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:08,599
I won't give up.

373
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,665
I need to make photo collection for fans.

374
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:11,932
I'll work hard.

375
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:17,932
Right, I feel sorry for fans, who won't get anything in return for making me first.

376
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,400
True.

377
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,999
They thought, that something good will happen after that.

378
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,532
Yeah, but only my shows ended.

379
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:26,999
They hoped for better.

380
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,665
I need to repay them.

381
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:30,333
We're here!

382
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,799
-You're right! That's fast!
-It's a battle field.

383
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:34,332
I won't lose.

384
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,532
-Let's do this?
-Let's do this.

385
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,800
Koubunsha, est.1945, a big player in publishing.
Magazines under their name: "Josei Jishin", "JJ", "FLASH", etc.

386
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,380
Fight!

387
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:55,532
It's 4 a.m. right now.

388
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,599
That idol is sleeping here,

389
00:19:58,933 --> 00:19:59,965
so be quiet.

390
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,332
It is 2:00 pm now.

391
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,065
The atmosphere is like that way.

392
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,599
An imitation of hotel prank.

393
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,399
It's a place where Aoki-san is sleeping.
Entertainment editorial department.

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,932
Rock-paper-scissors Tournament.

395
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:18,932
Aoki-san works only with AKB stuff?

396
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,065
Now. He is in charge of AKB parts.

397
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,399
In charge?

398
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,865
Probably.

399
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:28,199
It's entertainment editorial department,
but they work only with AKB?

400
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,132
Mainly with AKB.

401
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,865
I see.

402
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:34,999
Let's go.

403
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:41,932
Hello!

404
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,632
Please pardon us!

405
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,665
Hello!

406
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:47,932
Hello!

407
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,899
It's been a while.

408
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,999
-You wanted to talk about something?
-See his black eyes?

409
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:58,399
Looks like a fun job.

410
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,599
Yeah, it became an AKB room.

411
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,181
Amazing!

412
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,400
-That's probably a big turn-off.
-Not at all.

413
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:09,599
You said that you're not very popular with Aoki-san.

414
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,599
-Yeah.
-But there must be your pics.

415
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,732
There is my handwritten slogan.

416
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,066
-Look!
-Show me.

417
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,200
Look at this!

418
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,332
Don't joke around!

419
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,332
We always look at Sasshi's "Enjoy Life" slogan while working.

420
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,132
Isn't it great to do things the way you like?

421
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,532
See, he likes you!

422
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,680
-True!
-No, not that much.

423
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:33,532
He likes younger members. Not even Milky.

424
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,999
It looks like he changed his fave lately. I heard some rumors.

425
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,599
It's not Milky anymore.

426
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,799
-No way! Who is it now?
-Kojimako-chan.

427
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,699
Kojimako-chan?

428
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:45,732
Wait a minute! Here she is!

429
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:46,665
Kojimako!

430
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,399
He likes her.

431
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,065
-She is AKB member?
-Yes.

432
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:57,132
Remember when Milky wanted to release her photo collection,

433
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,999
after she asked him "I wanna have a photo collection", right?

434
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,465
Yeah, and there are lots of her pictures here.

435
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,199
But what changed?

436
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,365
Nothing.

437
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,932
But after she entered senbatsu,

438
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,999
it feels like she went far away.

439
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,265
It's lonely.

440
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,465
Like she had left the nest.

441
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,180
Because you published her photo collection, it feels like it?

442
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,999
Yeah, after it was published, she stepped up

443
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:26,465
-and entered senbatsu, didn't she?
-Yes.

444
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:29,332
Because of that it became harder to talk to her.

445
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,399
She's like a distant figure now.

446
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,865
I started calling her Milky-san.

447
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:36,932
So a while ago during the election, we were together.

448
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,232
-Right.
-Backstage and in the hall.

449
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:45,065
-So, what do you call it where members were lined up?
-Ah, for the pictures?

450
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,065
-Lined up for shooting?
-After you became 1st.

451
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,999
They took pictures of you.

452
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,532
So Aoki-san and I showed up
where everyone was taking pictures.

453
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,980
So Milky waved at us, right?

454
00:22:57,933 --> 00:23:01,132
But I was in front of Fukuda-san.

455
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:05,399
I thought she waved to me and waved back,
but her sight was on Fukuda-san.

456
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,065
She didn't even look at me for a second.

457
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,133
Not a second!

458
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,199
"You already published mine,
so I don't need any more photo books".

459
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,199
Because Milky aims to be an actress.

460
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:18,332
"My ambition is high, photo book is no longer a big deal for me now."

461
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,320
Aoki: Photo collection done, and it's like my mission completed.
Sasshi: "Enough photo book for me, enough Aoki-san for me"?

462
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:24,799
It's like a stepladder.

463
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:26,866
A stepping stone...

464
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,999
You were a stepping stone for her.

465
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,240
Negotiation starts

466
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,732
We came with good topic...

467
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:37,399
Ah, right...

468
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,799
Could you put on a microphone?

469
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,299
Sorry for that.

470
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,799
Let's take seats.

471
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,665
I became so sweaty...

472
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:58,450
[All kinds of funny faces.
Original Sashihara is here all the way.]
