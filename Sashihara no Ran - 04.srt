OK, understood.

-Of course.

Wow, she is a complete embodiment of an idol.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,440
Not sure how to say it, but Sashihara-san is completely different from her usual self.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,540
She entered a state of mind because of the photo collection,
her expressions are really different.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,860
As expected, it is a complete opposite.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,360
To be honest, I am a bit worried that I had portrayed her poorly in my works.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,380
In my works she never shown this kind of expressions.

14

while traveling and messing around everywhere.

18

-Instantly she transformed into an idol.

In total how many photos are taken?

45
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,700
-A lot.
-From those, how many are used?

46
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,400
About 10 000 photos would be made, out of which only around 100 would be used.

47
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,090
Actually selecting those hundred pictures is a very tedious task.

48
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,760
-Who chooses them?
-Everyone picks over shots, like "I like this one".

49
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,440
First, we make contact print.

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,780
-There are others as well as the cameraman...
-All the photos are printed?

51

Not every one is to be printed.

52

After being narrowed down to about a thousand photos, they will be sent to the designer.

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,740
Afterwards the editing process can take up to a week.

54

Do you look at each individual photo yourself?

55
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,340

I looked at her photos every day for two weeks.

-For Aoki-san, that is a really fortunate thing.

-Yes.

59

While I was selecting photos,
I kept on thinking how cute she is.

60
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,450
-It is good that Oshima Yuko is cute, though.
-Of course Sasshi would also have many cute photos.

61
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,860
That'd be nice.

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,600
-Her time has come.
-Yes, she has what it takes.

166
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:58,630
Looking good. Since Sasshi is so into it, Kuwajima-san seems also a little unapproachable.

167
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,360
To honest, I have this feeling of "What are we doing here?"

168
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,820
-Aoki-san is a supervisor, right?
-During the shoot, it does seem like I am not needed.

169
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,460
-But you must be close to them.
-Right, but I can't approach now.

170
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,320
Honestly speaking, it seems like our filming crew is out-of-place.

171
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,190
They are unapproachable, right?

172
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,240
We shouldn't disturb this kind of atmosphere.

173
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,460
Even from here the view is not bad either.

174
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:42,480
The atmosphere is like on movie set. Isn't it good for an actress?

175
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,580
This girl would never show this kind of expressions when she is acting.

176
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,380
Always making those weird faces.

177
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,820
-I am sure Aoki-san can be in those photos as well.
-No, that's a taboo...

178
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,480
It's unacceptable for fans.

179
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,850
If the person is male, even staff is not allowed.

180
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,160
-The only ones that are acceptable are grandmas and cats
-Grandma and cats?

181
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,460
-Also grandpas, though I am grandpa as well.
-Grandpas are okay?

182
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,980
Why did you end up laughing at your own joke?

183
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,040
-Should we try to get closer?
-Let's see.

No bad. This has a very good feeling.

187
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,160
Facing Aoki-san's camera the expression doesn't seem good.

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,890
An umbrella was a bit in the way.

189
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,590
I am like Milky now:

190
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,030
"Since I got my photo collection,
I don't need you anymore, Aoki-san".

191
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,850
-I'm a stepping stone.
-Yeah.

192
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,380
-Hey, Sasshi, look!
-Ah, a crab!

193

195
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,160
Ah! It came out! This is bad! Should I put it back down?

196
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,960
Good! That is good!

197
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,290
I feel relieved now.

198

Poor fellow, I am putting it down.

199
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,890
Looking at Sashihara being back to usual self,
makes me feel relieved.

200
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,440
Sasshi, we'll go eat later and I am thinking,

201
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,150
maybe we shouldn't have come here?

202
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,550
It's more like...

203
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,400
I think you didn't come here
with work in mind to begin with.

204
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,900
You came thinking this work would be a walk in the park.

205
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,230
And it's not good, that you're
showing me this attitude of yours.

206
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,780
I can feel that you guys think
"Isn't it OK not to work today?"

207
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,720
I can feel it.

208
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:16,840
Really? I was also trying to capture this vague playful atmosphere.

209
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,070
I thinking you guys are too relaxed.
When Ono-san was wearing an Okinawan t-shirt,

210
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,800
I didn't recognize him and greeted,
thinking he was a local grandpa.

211
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,530
You are too relaxed.

212

I see. Ono-san is indeed looks like local.

213
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,850
Too overboard, you guys are just bad.

214
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,150
-Honestly, I think your facial expressions are different from usual.
-Really?

215
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,820
-It's hard for us to approach you.
-You and your jokes!

They are kind of beautiful...

217
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,390
Well, yeah, that's true...

218
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,740
Without this expression you have now,
it's hard to approach you.

219
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,390

Did you hear, Abiru-san? Film only 20 minutes, okay?

225
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:24,460
Abiru-san will pay for dinner only if we will film it.

227

Go ahead complain to Abiru-san,
just pretend he is standing right there.

228
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,860
There isn't anything to complain about, just why he didn't come to the filming location?

229
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,050
He couldn't, so he sent him as substitute.

230
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,520
Why? What's he busy with?

231
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,190

-What various things?

232

-Yeah.

I don't understand what is so fun about the beach.

I think you guys did come here for that.

280

what did you come here for?

285
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,020
-Right...
-I just was considerate and didn't ask.

It's better for you to return to Tokyo and continue writing script.

287

Actually Ono-san has been very busy lately.

288

289
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,340
-The one with Fukuda-san.
-Ah, with a member of "Kis-My-Ft2"?

290
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,200
You should seriously write that script,
instead of being here on Okinawa.

291
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,030
"Kis-My-Ft2" member is probably thinking,
why are you so late with the script?

292
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,260
Looks like that.

293
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,400
No wonder. That's why you should hurry up and write it.

294

Kitayama from "Kis-My-Ft2" would probably cry
from happiness, if he'd hear that.

Honestly speaking, I worked on Fukuda-san's dramas and I must say...

298
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,280
But it's fun! To go on location and do nothing.

299
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,530
That's what a vacation is called.

300
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:19,520
Isn't it? It is really enjoyable work
of just going to location and observing.

301
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,960
