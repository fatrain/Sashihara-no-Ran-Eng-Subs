00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,430
-Sashihara-san is so different from her usual style.
-Yeah, different. In all she's an idol.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,080
-It's surely going to be a great photo collection.
-Definitely great.

00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:13,290
[But...]

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,350
"We can just slack off", that's probably the only reason you guys are here.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,990
I can deeply feel what you guys are thinking right now: "Why not? Not bad to slack off a little bit."

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,530
Is it really OK? Our show's first day in Okinawa...

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,060
I'm quite surprised that we have such low workload here.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,550
WHAT? It should be me who's kinda surprised.

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,820
Tomorrow, A hell of big surprise will be brought by Team "Sashihara's Rebellion".

[First, it's a photo session with animals]

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,410
First time with a goat?

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,490
-First photo session ever with a goat?
-Not sure. I can't remember at all.

14
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,650
I can't say it's definitely not the first time though.

[A meeting with goats]

16
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,030
Exciting, isn't it?

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,430
I'm not that excited to meet a goat.

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,670
Maybe I'll be, when I see it.

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,730
-It's said Okinawan goat soup is quite famous.
-Ew.

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,710
Watch your steps.

21
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,330
You talk about goat soup when you are on the way to meet them?

22
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,490
Terrible! Awful!

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,600
Terrible! It's just a friendly photo session.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,440
-What the hell are you talking about?
-It's kinda terrible.

Sashihara's Rebellion

26
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:54,710
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

27
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,679
to challenge several projects,
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,880

Cute.

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,010
They enjoy their food.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,810
You can touch them.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,650
-Just like that.
-Scary, scary, scary....

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,010
Forget it. I can't do that. I'll pass.
Looks like It doesn't like it too.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,510
In photo collections, when there are animals, the visual effect is usually good. Especially the facial expression.

36
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,570
That soft smile is exactly what we want.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,270
If shooting alone, it'd be difficult to take her natural smile. 'Cause she's an idol.

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,770
All credits to these goats. I'm really thankful.

-Sasshi, Sasshi.
-Yes?

41

-How are those goats? -They are cute.
-Right, and you have a nice expression...

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,910
I noticed something. Where is Fukuda-san?

43
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,020
Fukuda-san, eh.. He isn't here.

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,040
-He contacted me through Line.
-What happened?

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,120
It seems that he's writing script for
another show. He apologized for it.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,520
But he will come in evening.

47
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,230
You are talking so much,
that I can't even thrust in a word.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,280
What? So he isn't here? Writing script?

[Fukuda Yuuichi will be later]

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,544
So he is in an Okinawan hotel,
which is paid for by money we got

51
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:46,530
for the photo collection project of "Sashihara's Rebellion"?

52
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,500
-Writing script in a hotel which he didn't pay for?
-Yeah.

53
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,930
-I didn't tell you at the beginning not to spoil your mood.
-Like my mood isn't spoiled when you tell me now!

54
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,240
I thought it'd be better to tell you after finishing your session with goats.

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,990
-It doesn't matter if this is finished or not.
-Your nice expression is important.

56
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,350
-Really? I can't believe it.
-Yes, and I'm quite surprised as well.

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,570
He can just go home and write whatever he likes.
Why does he write it in an Okinawan resort?

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,220
-Like he's a famous writer.
-Ya, famous writer.

59
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,820
-Writing his own thing and let other people pay for it.
-Writing while watching the sea...

60
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,480
-Ridiculous.
-I wonder if he's gonna write something great?

61
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,100
He's really carefree.

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
Actually we didn't want you to notice that.

63
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,630
Of course I noticed that!
Such a big guy missing...

64

-That's not enough.
-Well, that didn't work.

You were just playing with those goats, right?

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,910
I saw how you took photos of them.

74
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,430
For the time being, we should wait for director Fukuda.

-I am.

How is your "Kis-My-Ft2" thing?

88
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,120
That "Kis-My-Ft2" thing.

89
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,730
Well, I won't deny, that I was writing
the script for "Kis-My-Ft2".

You are kinda awful.

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,740
Terrible.

92
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,370
Didn't you tell me yourself last evening,
that I can just go to write script for "Kis-My-Ft2"?

93
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,238
(Video evidence): It's definitely better for you to just go back to Tokyo and write your script.

94
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,960
You should write that script for "Kis-My-Ft2" drama.

95
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,050
Seriously. You don't need to be here in Okinawa.

96
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,050
It's OK to write it, but do it in the evening!

97
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,660
You only appear in the evening,
when there is fun and meal.

98
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,020
Isn't that weird?

99
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,330
I mean, when everybody were enjoying dinner,
you could work hard writing it.

100
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,980
So when everyone goes out for dinner,
I need to go back to my room to write the script?

101
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,740
In that case, I would definitely appreciate your
hard work and encourage you to keep it up!

102
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,430
-But I need to eat.
-Just buy some food in a convenience store!

103

Don't join our dinner!

104
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,770
In short, terrible.

105
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,980
-But you'll feel lonely eating without me, right?
-No. Not a bit.

106
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,440
I enjoy eating alone.

107
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,230
I prefer that.

108

smiling all the time, right?

109
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,690
No, no...

110
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,930

115

he started talking to me, so I don't like him.

Seriously, you really need to do something from now on.

124
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,370
If you don't, it doesn't make sense for you coming here.

125
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,980
And I'll quit the show after episode #3 or #4.

126
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,700
You guys can change it to "Fukuda's Rebellion".

Aren't you a little happy, when you see us from a distance during the shooting?

136
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,720
To be honest, my facial expression
was very good when you weren't around.

I can easily spot you guys messing around over there.

138
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,610

I start to doubt if we should have come here.

148
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,430
Even if we could film from here, but what we film here won't be useful for "Sashihara's Rebellion".

-Only "Black Sasshi".

In all, what I want to say is,

152

I want to return to hotel and continue writing my script.

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,910
Somehow a little bit like Paruru.

165
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,780
How do you see her like Paruru?

166
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,610
The hairstyle is similar...

167
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,360
She's cute because she looks like Paruru?

168
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,550
Doesn't her hairstyle resemble Paruru's?

169
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,760
It's the stylist...

170
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,130
You mistook the stylist for Sasshi?

171
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm really terrible...

172
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,510
Dude, after all the person you called cute, is the stylist.

173
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,210
I didn't even get, that you mistook the stylist for Sasshi!

174
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,580
-Her fans will be angry at you.
-We are really carefree.

175
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,220
Sasshi's fans will be pissed.

176
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,940
Ah, we're in their way.

177
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,810
Confirmed. We are doing nothing, but getting in their way.

178
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,180
Let's go.

179
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:19,196
[Since we are getting in their way]

180
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,120
Seems delicious.

181
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,090
-And large portion.
-It's said that these guys have the best tacos in Okinawa.

182
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,290
You were slacking off as well.

185
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,240
-Is it OK to skip your work?
-Actually I should be there to check the costumes.

186
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,610
This is really not good.

187
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,140
On the contrary, I am looking forward to seeing,
how the photos will work out, when they are ready.

188
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,230
-A reader's viewpoint, huh?
-Yes.

189
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,650
-Looking forward to see how Sasshi's work will pan out.
-You'll be the first reader.

190
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,190
Let's buy some presents for her.

191
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,040
-Taco.
-Cool.

192
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,690
It'll be OK with this, because it's really delicious.

193
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,210
We need to try it first, to make sure she likes the flavor.

194
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,520
Ah, you a right.

195
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,510
-Good idea.
-Yes.

196
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,520
-We tried these out, for her.
-Tried out in advance.

197
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,050
We came here to try these out for Sasshi.

198
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,542
[Just a tasting]

199
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,340
Is our present ready?

200
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:51,210
She'll forgive us after she eats these tacos.

201
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,200
-So, shall we just go for afternoon tea?
-Good idea.

202
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,920
Is it OK not to go back to work?

203
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,160
It's better if we bring this to her in lunch time.

204
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,610
The timing will be ideal when she is hungry.

205
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,680
We can tell her that it took quite a long time to find this.

206
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,680
So sly... That's why Sasshi call him "Evil Aoki"?

207

-How's your shooting?
-Fine.

212
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,220
-We thought we shouldn't be in your way.
-Yes, it's been quiet since then.

213
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,190
This is the best taco in Okinawa.

214
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,600
Taco? I don't like it that much, though.

215
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,400
-We already poison tasted it.
-Tasted for poison?

216
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,940
Seriously, I'm totally fine with the fact that Team Fukuda left for lunch.

217
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,810
In all, their work are not related to our shooting.

218
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,730
And I understand that you got hungry,

219
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,790
but you are simply ridiculous, Aoki-san!

220
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,670
I'm totally fine with Team Fukuda. They are free and they can't shoot anything when I'm in bikini anyway.

221
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,460
They don't have work to do, so it's OK to have lunch,

222
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,290
but it's ridiculous for you to leave as well, Aoki-san!

223
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,160
He is the person in charge, right?
I've told him that as well...

224
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,200
-Ridiculous!
-..."Is it really OK for you not to check the costumes?"

-Great!

-Really delicious.

-I forgive you now. I forgive you.

-We are even now.
-Even?

236
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,170
Not you, Aoki-san. I wasn't talking to you.

237
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,840
Aoki-san should have stayed with me during shooting.

238
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,910
I thought I was forgiven...

239
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,890
-Delicious.
-Great, now it's all Aoki-san's problem.

240
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,200
It's me who suggested buying this for you.

241
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,460
And "Koubunsha" will pay for it.

242
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,130
Stingy!

243
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,400
-So it's "Koubonsha"'s treat...
-Delicious.

244
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,860
It's great to solve my "Kis-My-Ft2" issue just with some taco.

245
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,470
Because they are really good.

246

-You are forgiven. You've done some work.

247

-Yey!
-Eh? That has nothing to do with you, seriously.

248
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,570
Well actually this is also an important job for me.

249
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,410
But Fukuda-san could have done it without you.

250
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,630
No, Fukuda-san is afraid of loneliness.

251
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,730
Yes. It's more fun when Aoki-san is around.

252
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,890
Alright. Our work here is done.

Why do you become a part of Team Rebellion?
I really can't understand it.

[Shooting comes to an end]

262
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,530
So how is it, Sashihara-san? Do you still want to make photo collections in the future?

263
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,720
It's probably enough for me.

264
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,390
I can enjoy this shooting when
I think this would be my last one.

265
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,400
I see. Just one more and you are done?

266
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,480
It would be fine if I publish my last one two years later.

What's your life plan, Sasshi?

268
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,740
Last photo collection two years later.
Does it mean you'll still be an idol then?

269
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,430
Not necessarily 2 years. I'll publish my last one when I graduate in several years.

270
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,820
So you'll be in AKB at that time?

271
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,310
Forget about two years.
I meant, that I'll publish it when I graduate.

272
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,040
-From being an idol?
-Yes, I'll release it when I graduate from being an idol.

273

-As the graduate souvenir. -Yes.
-And that's it?

What do you plan after that?

275
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,860
Haven't decided yet. Just want to live happily.

276
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,710
I really haven't planned any goals.

277
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,510
Does it mean you'll pursue variety talent career?

278
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,190
It's not the only way. If I wanna get married, it'll be fine too. I'll do whatever I want to do most at that time.

279
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,740
I see. But it doesn't look like you seek for love now, right?

280
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,290
Who knows?... It's OK to unrequited love in AKB.

281
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,400
-Unrequited love is fine?
-Yes.

282
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,020
So these things are up to my own decisions.

-Why do you call him godly?
-Very geeky.

299
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,220
It's rare to meet such cute kitty.

300
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,990
It softened Sasshi's slightly nervous and stiff face.

301

You thought I was nervous?

-Are you not nervous?
-I'm not nervous whatever I do.

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,070
Then we'll try to follow this plan.

328
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,310
Let's visit Takke Yukataka.
Let's visit Take Yutaka.

329
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,660
Horse racing fans will be pissed at you, seriously. 
"Sashihara, you bastard!"

330
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,890
A project of visiting Take Yutaka.

331
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:10,366
[Though it's not aired, there are bikini scenes in this photo collection]

332
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,060
This show became a hot topic
among people in show business.

333
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,550
No please. Don't watch it.

334
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,060
They are talking a lot about it.

335
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,530
I want to do whatever I like,
but without people watching it.

336
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:29,510
Someone that hasn't contacted me for a while, messaged me "Sashihara's Rebellion is really funny!"

337
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,250
To be honest, it will be bothersome if TV ratings goes up.

338
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,590
It's scary. I'd rather do it away from the spotlight.

339
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,050
-We talked about horse racing in Okinawa.
-Yes, I wanted to do the horse racing!

340
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:52,610
-After consideration, it's unlikely to happen. You don't have time on weekends. -That's true, I have handshakes.

341
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,320
And horse racing are basically hosted on weekends only.

342
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,070
Ah, is that true? Then no way.

343
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,710
-And about Take Yutaka, whom you called "that dude"...
-Ah, I'm really sorry.

344
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:20,750
"That dude" is racing on weekends, but sometimes is free on Monday. He has a tight schedule on as well.

345
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:27,200
After we came back from Okinawa, Tsukamoto-san and "Ohta Pro" tried to arrange it,

346
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,730
-but he's busy on weekends.
-Why?!

347
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,690
-It's difficult.
-Forget it then.

348
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,150
I can only give it up. We have the schedule issue.

349
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:44,200
So, besides this, what ambition do you want to achieve?

350
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,480
I've thought about it carefully.

351
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,840
Let's make a movie of HKT.

352
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:52,916
[I want to make a HKT movie]

353
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,530
Producing a movie looks really complicated.

354
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,020
-Warning: I'll do something really big, might lead to accidents.
-No accidents allowed.

355
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,540
If possible, "Zakiyama-san" kindly accept our offer to become the director.

356
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,460
Your movies are all very famous.

357
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:21,200
-Sounds like you only heard of them instead of watched them.
-No, no. I've watched every one of them. Watched, watched...

358
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,290
You definitely have not. Why don't you talk to me when looking at my eyes?
