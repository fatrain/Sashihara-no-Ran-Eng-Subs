00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,070
I'd like to let you know
the taste of the really delicious grilled meat.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,720
-You know, I go to steak houses quite often!
-Yeah, I thought so,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,590
but I am no stranger to grilled meat too...

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,620
Is it OK to show this face to fans?

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,760
Yes. This Is Anago from "Sazae-san".

6
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:20,801
[That being said...]

00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:33,801
[Grilled meat rebellion]

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,270
-We have a surprise guest!
-Eh, who?!

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,830
-With this guest we may make 3 episodes!
-Are you serious?

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,780
Big guest!

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,360
Sorry, but we're filming here...

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,230
It's Aoki-san!

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,550
-Look at her face.
-Please make it at least 1 mm happy.

14
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,477
[And another one!]

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,460
-Another special guest...
-Eh?!

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,870
-Arrived?
-Yes.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,330
-I think you'll like this guest.
-Really?

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,530
But it's not Kojiharu.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,410
There is no way Kojiharu-san would come to this show.

20
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,700
-I think you'll be happy seeing this guest.
-I am not expecting much anymore.

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,600
I think she'll make viewers happy too.

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,070
-Fukuda-san, hello!
-Ah, Miyuki!

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,690
Miyuki!

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,940
Miyuki-chan!

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,950
-Miyuki, what are you doing here?
-I've been called.

26
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,970
-Yes. -Miyuki-chan! I am really happy!

27
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,130
I feel completely different now. Yey!

28
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,880
-Finally in "Sashihara's Rebellion"...
-A semi-regular Milky!

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,520
-It's "Sashihara's Rebellion", right?
-Yes. We've been talking about you all the time.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,790
I thought you'd like to come.
So I am happy now!

31
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,690
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,930
-Milky, we've been eating grilled meat here.
-Join us. - Ah, with pleasure.

Sashihara's Rebellion

34
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:29,788
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

35
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:34,539
to challenge several projects,
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

36
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,900
Cheers!

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,930
-Hooray, Milky came!
-Aoki-san became silent.

38
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,930
Fan of Kojimako.

39
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,030
Are you a fan of Kojimako?

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,230
-He used to be your fan...
-He was famous for being your fan.

41
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,990
I am still known for being her fan.

42
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,620
Well, somehow,

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,300
-he felt like you went far away after entering Senbatsu,
-And photo book was already published.

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,380
so he switched to Kojimako-chan.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,550
-That's not true. -Are you sad? -I am.

46

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,150
Ah, the real thing!

48
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:19,400
-UpsetMilky appeared. -It's totally different!
-So you really say it? - Yes.

49
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,390
-I always thought Aoki-san made it up.
-Me too! -You are wrong.

50
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,760
I've read it on Milky's Google+.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,950
HappyMilky, sadMilky and upsetMilky - 3 levels of usage.

52
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,830
What the heck is that?

53
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,590
It's just in Aoki-san's eyes,

54
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,250
Milky separated from him after Elections.

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,200
Not separated. Just became a bit distant figure.

56
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,040
Ah, fans frequently say that.

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,320
Well, Milky has probably seen it,

58
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,320
but next to Aoki-san's desk hangs a Kojimako's poster.

59
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,048

60
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,130
-It's not Milky anymore.
-No way! Who is it now? -Kojimako-chan.

61

-Kojimako-chan?
-Yes.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,340
Wait a minute! Here she is!

64

There is your poster as well.

65
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,760
That was just a malice of "Sashihara's Rebellion".

66
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,610
It's not malice. Wow, scary! You're terrible! Scary!

67
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,440
-He's blaming the show!
-Your poster is really there.

68

-Are you upset?
-Kojimako-chan's poster was huge.

69

Ah, Miyuki-chan!

71
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,890
Because of "Sashihara's Rebellion" a rumor that I switched had spread around

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,530
and even reached Osaka.
-There was even a photo where Milky was sulky, right?

73
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,130
-Yes, I am angry.
-I was framed, honestly.

74
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,160

-Looks good!

-Milky, grab some green onions.
-I love grilled meat.

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,520
-How cute. You love grilled meat? -Yes.

80
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,920
Milky, try meat with onions.

81
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,120
-With onions? Without sauce?
-Try with lemon.

82
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
Look at her reaction!

83
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,790
-It's so delicious! -What is this?
-Awesome!

-It melts. It's so tender. Delicious.

-Can you eat it in one bite?
-Absolutely. It melts.

-How cute!
-Awesome!

-Miyuki-chan... TastyMilky?

-It's tastyMilky.
-Is it tastyMilky?

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,990
What the hell was that "is it tastyMilky" about?

91
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,650
-I turn polite.
-Why?

I am polite, right?

93
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,520
But you just asked yourself, if you are polite!
Which is it? Geez. What the heck?

94
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,240
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a really good title, isn't it?

95
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,990
You're praising me so much. I am happy.

96
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,200
Is it possible to make a Milky corner in it?

Here she comes!

98
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,310

What kind of situation is that?

99
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,760

I will, I will! Starting from next week!

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,440
It's just lip service, right?

104

-Lip service.
-Let's make Milky's corner.

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,720
-You know, that viewership rating
of this show is really low. -And it's not aired in Osaka.

106
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,760
Better ask for a starring role in drama.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,610
But this show is incredibly popular
among showbiz people.

108
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,820
That's the most important thing.
Even NHK producer said it:

109
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,840
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is the shit!"

110
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,070
-Then I'll make an appeal.
-It's NHK!

111
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,370
Everyone, please make Milky's corner.

112

-Right! You're a regular already.
-I am happy!

116
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,230
We use the same picture every time.

117
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,570
It became a topic at one of our meetings.

118
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,090
Shouldn't we change that picture?

119
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,590
-It's really old, right?
-No, it's a recent one.

120
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,560
-Recent?
-Yes, probably.

121
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,630
I've remembered it. It's like this.

122
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,160
That picture has imprinted in my mind!

123
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,020
I've remembered this Miyuki-chan's photo.

-Oh, what's this?
-Skirt steak.

125

[Skirt steak]

127
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,330
I am always praising Milky,
but Aoki-san never does.

128
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,680
I do!

129
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,900
If it's just the two of us, he normally talks to me.

130
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,630
But if someone's around, he becomes silent.

131
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,870
Eh, cold outside, sweet inside? That's scary!

132
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,440
He's sweet when you two are alone?
It's planned. He's a schemer!

133
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,820
-Why are you acting cold, Aoki-san?
-I don't.

134
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,840
-Do you think Milky will come to you,
if you leave her alone? -I don't think that.

135
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,550
Do you see her as your wife?

136
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,990
I even went to her grandmother's house
for the photo book shooting.

137
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,590
Right?

138
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,410
So this is how people turn into stalkers.

139

Stalker is a bit... Don't film me...

140

eating grilled meat! Seriously!

-That old man! ("East's" producer Hatano Ken)

like "Hard work will fulfill your dreams",

But it was super cold in countryside where we filmed

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,400
-Well, we can make "Steak's Rebellion"
in some episodes again. -And call a guest then.

326
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:46,290
[I'll wait for it]

327
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,420
-The next project... -What?
-You've mentioned it previously - horse racing.

328
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,070
-I've made arrangements.
-Yey!

329
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,830
-You've always wanted to buy betting tickets with your own money. -Oh, need to bring money then!

330
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,630
It's at "Ohi Racecourse".

331
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,610
-"Ohi Racecourse"
-Is it near?

332
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,730
-An evening races.
-So happy!

333
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,800
-Let's go!
-So will be our next project.

334
00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:13,040
[The bill]

335
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,370
-So today's bill...
-Who is paying?

336
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,880
Most probably Dentsu. But they just wrote something.

337
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,940
Have Milky coax him and make it cheaper.

338
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,440
Nice idea! We're counting on you.

339
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,350
So now Milky is going to ask
Aoi-chan to decrease the bill.

340
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,720
-Please. So this show can continue.
-Okay, start now.

341
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,120
It was delicious, wasn't it?

342
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,780
I'll come again, Aoi-tan. Please make it cheaper.

343
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,880
Okay, I'll chip in a little money.

344
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,980
Thank you very much!

345
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:10,670
-Geez, Milky... Anyone will fall for her charms.
-You get enchanted.

346
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,180
-That's good. We're lucky.
-Lucky!

347
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,487
You just can't help it...

348
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,794
[In gratitude, Sashihara and Milky wrote a menu signs]

349
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:25,549
[Nemul - 800 yen]

350
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:35,440
[Salty large intestine - 1000]

351
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:40,107
[It's not only ugly faces, but also imitations!]

352
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:45,784
[Their quality is questionable though]
