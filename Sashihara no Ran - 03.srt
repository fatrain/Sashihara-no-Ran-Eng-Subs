1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,160
I want to release a photo collection.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,100
This is where Aoki-san sleeps.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,700
Good morning, it's been a while...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,120
I'll do it, even if only with seaweeds to cover myself with.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,610
-I understand.
-Eh?!

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,190
-You hear that? -He agreed to it!
-He did.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,440
-Hello, it's been a while.
-Been a while.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,560
-Sorry for calling you out suddenly.
-It's okay.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,640
-According to Sasshi, you take the best pictures of her.
-Thank you for the compliment.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,190
He is popular among 48G members,
because his photos are very good.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,580
-Kuwajima-san seem like a very busy person.
-Certainly does.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,670
Actually, I haven't had much work in September.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,430
I was actually panicking, thinking "Crap!",

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,570
so I've been going around marketing myself.

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,820
-You had to find job yourself?!
Well, yes.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,850
And then I started to receive job offers again.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,690
-Even you had to do it?!
-Actually all photographers do it.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,810
You have to find your own jobs.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,360
Really? I thought you were super popular.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,950
Our days are passed with fear of uncertainty.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,530
-You are paid in a commission system, right?
-Yes, I'm also same as him.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,510
-No wonder Fukuda-san moves to a house with such high rent. -Please don't bring that up!

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,770
What's this about?

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,750
-He'll live in a house with very expensive rent.
-Really? Wow.

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,960
Please spare me from this.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,650
It's OK, but you should think about it.

27
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:38,937
Sashihara's Rebellion

28
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:45,688
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

29
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,721
to challenge several projects,
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,960
-Let's get to the point now please.
-Yeah.

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,510
Actually, I decided to release a photo collection and would like you to be my photographer.

32
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,110
Absolutely.

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,610
Even if you said that,
we still have to talk about the money.

34
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,700
Wouldn't we talk about it when the time comes?

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,280
-I'd like to get it done now to avoid complications.
-Sounds good to me.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,390
-You may say it's too little for you later.
-Yeah, I want to avoid a dispute.

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,820
Aoki-san's did an estimation,
even though it should be a secret...

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,550
We were discussing whether we should fly business class or economy.

39
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,210
We wish you'll consider taking business... I mean economy class fight.

40
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,540
-Wait, me? -Yeah.
-Of course, I can take economy class flight.

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,960
-Ah, that's a relief.
-Who am I to take business class flight?

42
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,990
-Even when doing work overseas?
-No, it costs a lot of money.

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,580
Look, how kind of him, unlike (that photograph).

44
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:49,608
Don't say it!

45
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,580
-So, no business, just economy is fine?
-That's a relief. -Yeah, all good.

46
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,500
[A fee problem]

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,450
Normally, the fee is this much...
But wait, I am not finished yet. It's not that.

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,380
-Aoki-san said, that Kuwajima-san's fee is probably this much. -That's quite a bit...

49
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,300
-He said it should be this much.
-This rate should be logical.

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,900
However, because we're rushing things, it's messy.

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,400
We would really appreciate it if you'd agree on this option.

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
-On the contrary, that's really generous.
-You serious? -Absolutely.

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,060
Wait, the circumstances have changed...

54
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,750
-Let's renegotiate... You are fine with that fee?
-Totally.

55
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,390
-Well, nice.
-Looks like we did it.

56
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,030
Such a nice deal.

57
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,950
If Kuwajima-san wouldn't accept this offer,
I don't think I could work with him again.

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,980
I'd think he's too greedy.

59
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,580
After all, isn't this the normal rate?

60
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,970
Actually, wouldn't this be the best option for Kuwajima-san?

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,710
If it sells, then you'll make even more right?

62
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,980
Compared to base fee, wouldn't getting a cut from the sales yield more money?

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,270
Yes, but only if it sells well.

64
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,010
-So, just the base fee option?
-Yes, that will do.

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,900
So, what photo collection is going to be like?

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,800
-A more mature theme?
-Like "Santa Fe".

67
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,940
What the heck?

68
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,080
Just forget about it.

69
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,730
"Santa Fe".

70
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,440
In other words, going nude is fine.

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,600
Santa Fe, Santa Fe.

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,920
-Please, don't go nude.
-"Santa Fe".

73
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:31,340
[Back to business]

74
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,720
-Guess we'll use this chance to talk to you about photography business. -Right.

75
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,080
-Normally... How much?..
-What do you mean?

76
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,160
I'd like to have something as reference
for future business meetings.

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,290
Usually different people have different fees.

78
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,180
For people of my age,
normally we'll just take the asking price.

79
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,000
-What does that mean?
-We'll take anything, high or low pay.

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,480
It's normally like that.
That said, it's unlikely to have horrible deals.

81
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,920
What if you're offered only $200?

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,520
Depends on the job.

83
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,950
For example, a magazine-cover for a
gravure model who you took care of.

84
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,120
And you are told "Sorry, we could only give you $200".

85
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,320
If it's the first time, I'd normally take it.

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,640
Eh?! Even $200?!

87
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,300
-What do you mean? You'll shoot a model for magazines for $200? -Yes, for magazines.

88
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,850
-How does it work for magazines?
-It's usually charged by pages.

89
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,530
Such as, how much they'll pay for each page of photos.

90
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,750
-Ah, by pages?
-What's the average rate for a page?

91
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,000
It's different for each media.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,790
What would it be for (some comic magazine)?

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,370
I can not reveal that.

94
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,180
Just tell me, I'll keep it to myself.

95
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,130
I really can't tell you.

96
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,770
But Aoki-san told me so much.

97
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,480
I'll... Tell you in secret, OK?

98
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,460
Under the desk, then.

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,710
-Eh? I don't get it... That's for one page?
-Yes.

100
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,970
But photographers and front covers have their own ranks.

101
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,500
Is that so?

102
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,460
For instance, comic magazines pay quite well.

103
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:19,480
We'll bleep this out later...
How much does (some magazine) pay for each page?

104
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,790
Down there again.

105
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,920
-Eh? That different?
-Yes.

106
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,580
That's because their number of sold copies is different.

107
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,930
-That's amazing.
-The difference is great.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,760
-We did our calculations, not expecting great sales, right?
-Yes, of course.

109
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,250
It's scary to assume it'll sell well.

110
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:00,990
However, Aoki-san is quite the professional, so he probably already taken everything into account.

111
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,090
Do you also think Aoki-san's eyes are scary?

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,980
Aoki-san surely have thought about this.

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,630
-About what?
-How much it'll sell.

114
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,550
I am sure he has a rough estimate in mind.

115
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:21,790
Truth be told, we didn't think
Aoki-san would agree to this proposal.

116
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,730
Moreover, Sasshi is not his favorite member.

117
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,510
Even though he published a photo collection for Milky.

118
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,830
"I want one. I want to release a photo collection".

119
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,400
I also understand him wanting to help Milky after being asked like that.

120
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,300
She said to a certain photographer

121
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,120
"Would you like to see me in a swimsuit?"

122
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
-It was me.
-Ah, right!

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:55,280
That was the first time I've worked with Yamamoto Sayaka-san and Milky-san for swimsuit photo shoot.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,950
Yamamoto-san simply left to change.

125
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,350
As for Milky, she held the swimsuit and said

126
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,270
"Do you want to see me in swimsuit?"

127
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,760
I answered "Yes".

128
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,760
-That's how you do it, Sashihara-san.
-Amazing.

129
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,750
-You're not good at this.
-It's impossible for me.

130
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,810
-I never even thought about it.
-Right?

131
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,420
I feel those who are hot right now can use those lines.

132
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,230
I think you're at your peak right now.

133
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:36,450
If you don't only use those lines when you're at your peak, then there's no meaning to it.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Honestly, we've been discussing dirty topics since morning.

135
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
It's really unpleasant,
let's talk about something refreshing.

136
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,770
-What do you think of her as model?
-I think she's wonderful.

137
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I learn from my sources that
I'm his favorite out of all AKB Groups.

138
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,260
That's true.

139
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:56,598
[Sashihara is his favorite?]

140
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,490
Eh? Why?

141
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,300
I watched Fortune Cookie, and it really made me happy.

142
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,700
I was so happy and I found her cute.

143
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,880
Maybe I should request to shoot a "Private Life" too?

144
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,790
-I'll invite him to my place.
-No, please don't.

145
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,640
-Taking photos of my meals.
-I don't want to see your personal life...

146
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,500
-Why not?
-She eats super plain dishes.

147
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,190
Like noodles. Everyday noodles.

148
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,030
-Everyday noodles in small doses.
-Only a bundle of it.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,880
-Don't you get hungry?
-No, I don't. It's OK.

150
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,080
-I'm happy.
-Me too.

151
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,720
With such excellent model,
there's nothing left to worry about.

152
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,840
Excellent? I was actually quite worried about this,

153
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,550
when she said about releasing photo collection.

154
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,630
For me, only girls with big boobs can release things like photo collections.

155
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,900
Face also, I thought idol should have cute face.

156
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:09,670
When she said she wants to release photo collection,
I thought she has no tools to pull it off.

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,410
I was worried about it.

158
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,050
I think she is very charming.

159
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,500
So kind!

160
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:27,290
I think her charm is different from "cute" and "nice figure" types.

161
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,130
When you say "cute face" and "nice body",
Kojiharu is first that comes to mind.

162
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,600
I think one's charm is not expressed
through face or body.

163
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,200
-The real photographer is something else!
-That means photographer sees things differently?

164
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,470
Yeah, probably...

165
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:52,000
Actually, nowadays girls doing gravure are different from before.

166
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,700
They are not all big breasted with nice bodies.

167
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,500
Therefore, I feel that those aren't the deciding factors.

168
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,980
I think it depends whether the girls looks
cute or beautiful in the photos.

169
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,200
What a fancy saying!

170
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,230
-Wow! -Ain't that amazing?
-Very artistic.

171
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,140
Really impressive, no wonder
they're paid so well.

172
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:27,100
-So if we have a photographer, this means?..
-We are all set.

173
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,340
I think we are ready to start.

174
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,160
What about the other staff?

175
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,380
-I brought my make-up artist with me.
-Wow.

176
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,650
-Amano-san will do my make-up.
-I see.

177
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,280
-How about the stylist and clothes?
-There's no problem.

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,500
-Anyone can do.
-Really? Anyone?!

179
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,030
Even my own clothes are fine.

180
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,540
-You don't need to prepare that yourself.
-Well, somebody will do it for me, right?

181
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,630
-Why don't we ask Kuwajima-san?
-Could you find them for me?

182
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,600
-Me?
-Yes, please.

183
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,490
-Yes, please.
-By the way, when will we start shooting?

184
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,030
-Probably around October.
-We'll discuss with "OhtaPro" this.

185
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,590
I'll manage my schedule.

186
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,520
-I'll find a suitable time for the schedule.
-Understood, thanks for that.

187
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,430
-Let's see, photographer - checked.
-Clothes - checked. Kuwajima-san will take care of it.

188
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,900
We have makeup artist Amano-san right over there.

189
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,080
-Should be okay.
-We should be ready to start.

190
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,500
-Yay!
-Can we start shooting?

191
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,730
-How about coordinator?
-Aoki-san will that care of that.

192
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,870
-Just leave it all to Aoki-san.
-If that's the case, then yes, we can start.

[Negotiations are over]

194
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,860
-We did it.
-Lucky.

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,920
-And only took us one day!
-We're really lucky, aren't we? A fortunate day.

196
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,690
-All photo collection preparations in one day...
-This is probably very abnormal...

197
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,320
-It's not normal.
-Kinda amazing, isn't it?

198
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,280
-Lucky, I'm glad.
-Maybe winning Election really raised your power?

199
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,460
First place has nothing to do with it,
we're just very lucky today.

200
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,870
But it's also partly because there's trust between you two.

201

-Yes, we have a long history.
-I've photographed her a lot.

202
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,570
-And Aoki-san didn't hate you.
-Yes.

203
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,750
He has my handwritten slogan.

204
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,230
-This is really great.
-Yes.

[Some day in October. Okinawa, Naha]

206
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,800
I am really grateful for this.
[Some day in October. Okinawa, Naha]

207
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,900
-That was fast...
-Yes, in a blink of an eye.

...implementation.

209
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,960
-Are preparations usually this fast?
-As long there's a will...

210
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,410
The biggest problem was to adjust Sasshi's schedule.

211
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:52,030
Once she's ready, we can prepare everything in a day. We're always in a stand by mode.

212
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,000
Was getting the "go" from management easy?

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,490
No problem from the company, I usually
call all the shots anyways.

214
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,990
Woah, did you get that?
"I usually call all the shots in the company"

215
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,540
For a second there, I thought I heard
"No one is above me in my company".

216
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,660
I didn't mean it that way.

217
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,660
How do I put it? I basically said it's AKB,
mentioned Sashihara, and boom, got the approvals.

218
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,280
So Sasshi, you're the red-hot tag that allowed it.

219
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,900
For some reason, the more you say that
the more I think this photo collection will flop.

[An important talk]

221
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,920
Thing is, we talked to Aoki-san earlier...

222
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,240
Apparently, our allowed budget is a bit lower
compared to average photo shoot budget.

223
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,420
Well, it was prepared on the short notice...

224
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,600
-We also demanded to shoot in Okinawa.
-Yeah.

225
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,710
-If only we really shoot it at "OhtaPro".
-Yes.

226
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:50,320
-But Kuwajima-san wanted the locations to be beautiful...
-Yes.

227
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,580
-Coming to Okinawa was a bit of a stretch.
-I know, we could've just shoot it in the city.

228
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,810
-Unfortunately we can only stay for 2 days and 1 night.
-Right.

229
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:07,620
It's going to be a tight schedule,
so even if it's already late,

230
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,500
I think we should visit the shooting locations.

231
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,850
Maybe go there tonight and start shooting at daybreak.

232
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,050
Finish everything, then come back the night after tomorrow.

233
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,640
This a schedule, that "Koubunsha" planned for us.

234
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,300
If it's 2 days, we can release a nice photo collection.

-What is it?

[Bad news]

237
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,440
Even though Aoki-san tried his best,

238
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,790
but we've just verified,

239
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,600
that if we include all staff of this photo collection,

240
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:57,160
we don't have the budget for a nice feast for them all.

241
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,950
That's probably because all of you came along!

242
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,090
The number of people increased!

243
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,040
-Right?
-Doubled the expanses.

244
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,660
-Right!
-We had to pay for Fukuda-san's crew too..

245
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,300
It's OK for you to be here,
because it's this show's project,

246

but you have to understand...

247
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,960
-... that we have no money, precisely because of that.
-We have to pay for all of you.

248
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:25,250
-But this photo collection project started,
because of this program, right? -That's also true.

249
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,400
-So we brought here as few people as we could.
-Yes.

250
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,190
And it's sad we don't get to eat...

251
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:39,050
Personally, I don't mind eating just cup noodles.
I eat it all the time anyway.

252
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:46,570

I feel it's wrong to not treat you all to a feast.

253

At this point I had to suggest paying for all of you,
however, I'm not willing to do so.

-Thank you and bye-bye.

319
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,030
-Done? -Done.
-Everything's done? Done.

320
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,820
He said "okay", as it wasn't such a big deal.

321
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,200
It's a small matter.

322
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:39,380
[Got the meals]

323
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,860
We got it in return for the filming.

324
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,740
Nice! Happy! Let's talk about inappropriate things.

325
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,300
Okay, let's begin inappropriate talk now.

326
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,200
Aoki-san is being flamed online right now.

327
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,280
Even though he had to do the 16 person Rock-paper-scissors Senbatsu cover, he put 1 person on the cover,

328
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,370
so he's getting super flamed.

329
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,500
-The one you showed me, a Jurina-chan only cover?
-Personally, I don't think it's a big deal.

330
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,840
In the past it has always been 16 people,
but it was always a hard choice.

331
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,990
Because the picture of the victory moment was always really good.

332
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,130
You never did it, but this time
a sudden change? Huh?!

333
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,480
Well, it's already the 4 time, so I kinda wanted to change things up.

334
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,410
-It looks like you've really suffered.
-Yeah, I'm a little upsetMilky.

335
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,900
"UpsetMilky" my ass! What are you saying, geez?

336
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,460
So you're enjoying trip to Okinawa while being flamed?..

337
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,380
He's smashed to pieces right now while being flamed.

338
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,440
-No, no, it's not like that.
-Right, Aoki-san?

339
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,770
-He's saying stuff like sadMilky.
-I just wanted to make everybody excited about Rock-paper-scissors Tournament.

340
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,750
But if you think about it, saying stuff like sadMilky, he's gone insane. Was it sadMilky?

341
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,370
-UpsetMilky.
-Right, upsetMilky.

342
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,920
-Saying upsetMilky is pretty bad.
-He's a bit too cheerful for upsetMilky.

343
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,960
Even 12 hours haven't passed since the flame start.

344
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,340
During tough times I'm upsetMilky.

345
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,310
I end up adding "Milky" to everything.

346
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,740
-Let's just check in for the day. -Yes, lucky!
-We have to wake up early tomorrow.

347
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,230
Let's get some sleep! Thanks for the hard work!

348
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,180
Nighty-night-Milky!

349
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,160
-Aoki-san, nighty-night-Milky!
-Nighty-night-Milky!

350
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,720
Sashihara-san look different from usual.

351
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,220
-It's like a switch is flipped.
-Her expression during photo shoot is quite different.

352
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,000
-This should turn out to be a nice photo collection.
-Yes, it's likely to be very good.

353
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:47,720
The air feels heavier around Sasshi,
making it hard to approach her.

354
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,910
Awesome!

355
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,160
A LINE message came!

356
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,580
[On the other hand, "Sashihara's Rebellion" crew...]

357
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:03,340
Today we can't hide the fact that we are completely slacking off.

358
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,951
[Nothing to do...]

359
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,690
Aren't you guys being too carefree?

360
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,210
There's "I don't have to work today"
feel around you bunch.

361
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,410
It's annoying seeing you all slacking and smiling.

362
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,820
At this rate, I'd probably quit by the 3rd or 4th episode.

363
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,210
Change the show to "Fukuda's Rebellion".

364
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,040
-If you all keep slacking off, I'll really quit.
-Understood.
