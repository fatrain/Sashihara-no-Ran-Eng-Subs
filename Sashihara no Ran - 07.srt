1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,740
I want to make a HKT movie!

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,530
-Ah, right, you are theater manager?
-Yes!

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,870
That's why I think a lot about HKT now.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,500
-I wanted to do a show helpful to people.
-Wonderful!

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,590
-Hello. Please excuse me. I am Sashihara Rino
from HKT48, nice to meet you -Hello.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,480
-Haven't you watched director's movies?
-No.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,770
-She doesn't watch my movies.
-Watch them!

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,610
-She does't watch them at all.
-"Kids Police"?

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,690
Ah, I had a minor role in it!

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,500
-She doesn't even watch those she starred in.
-Oh my...

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,780
She doesn't watch them even though she attends PR event for upcoming movie with me.

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,900
-I can't sit through a movie.
-Why? Are you a sparrow?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,520
When I watch a movie,
I can't sit still, need to move.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,210
-So such girl... -I want to make a movie.
-Eh, why don't you try?

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,590
He said it like he has nothing to do with it.

16
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:03,716
Sashihara's Rebellion

17
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:11,006
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

18
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:15,894
to challenge several projects,
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,060
I heard you've produced a lot of movies...

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,310
How much money you earn
if a movie becomes a hit?

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,710
This kind of silly talk?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,450
-If one becomes a hit.
-If it's a hit?..

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,980
It's case-by-case, right?

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,980
Well, when I was employed in a company

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,580
I didn't get an interest, if a movie was a hit.

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,980
-Is that so? -Of course!
-So you get the same payment for flop and hit?

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,810
If you're an employee.

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,570
-So when you became independent producer...
-This is what happens.

29
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,720
You've got a call.

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,450
Directors don't get interest either?

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,260
It's difficult... Directors can get interest,
but producers don't get at all.

32
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,800
Is that so?..

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,430
So that's when movie's Box Office is $100 millions,
I get asked how much did it cost to produce.

34
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,530
And if a movie was made on $7 millions they foolishly think that $93 millions went in my pocket.

35
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,730
-Yeah, I am the type to think like that.
-She'd think like that.

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,110
-You know...
-Yes?

37
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,870
It's completely wrong.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:33,910
Movie theaters rent movies not at retail ticket price,
but at wholesale price, which is 50% cheaper.

39
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,360
Wow, you've been called a lot!
It can't be helped, you must be very busy.

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,130
You have a next appointment.

41
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,650
[Phone been turned off]

42
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,480
Because of wholesale price
$100 millions in reality are $50 millions.

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,320
-Ah, that's the profit you actually get.
-Yes, right.

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,830
-So who gets those $50 millions?
-Well, we, since we made a movie,

45
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,940
but out of those $50 millions we have to pay a distribution commission.

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,890
-To whom you pay distribution commission?
-To film distributor.

47
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,120
-Toho?
-Correct.

48
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,300
-Zaboom! -But not only to Toho!
-It's not Toho!

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,620
-Film distributors like Toho get around 35%. -I see...

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,180
-35%?!
-Yes.

51
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,770
But before that there is a production cost
and also advertising expanses.

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,490
-For posters at Shibuya or TV commercials.
-Yes, or newspaper ads.

53
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,970
Sorry to interrupt, but what does P&A mean?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,917
[P&A]

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:48,970
It means Prints and Advertising.

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,800
-Prints? -Prints are different now
when 99% of films are shot on digital cameras.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,680
-Back in the days, you needed 100 film prints to show in 100 theaters. -Ah, film copies!

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,950
-So 300 copies for 300 theaters.
-Are they expensive?

59
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,180
Yes. 1 copy costs $3 000.

60
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,130
So for 100 theaters you need $300 000.

61
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,350
And for 300 theaters you need $1 million.

62
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,570
Not so loud!

63
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,330
-This is sick!
-Not so loud!

64
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,520
And there is also advertising costs. For CMs.

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,700
-Are TV ads expensive?
-Of course!

66
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,400
So those movies that are heavily advertised
are expensive to produce? -Yes.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,780
There were lots of CMs of "The Complex".

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,420
Do you feel excited if your movie is doing great?

69
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,440
Of course it feels good.

70
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,760
How is it doing?

71
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,460
It wasn't released yet! But it'll be a problem if it flops.

72
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,710
-When is a premiere?
-On 21st of December.

73
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,070
-Come and see it! Please!
-Yes, please.

74
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,110
-Sorry, but can I ask a dumb question? -Sure.

75
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,110
Who covers a production cost? Investors?

76
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,640
In short, yes, investors. They join Production Committee.

77
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,020
-Listen about Production Committee.
-There is a Production Committee.

78
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:14,100
[Production Committee]

79
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,910
-Ah, there it is.
-There is a lot of investors who joined it, about 16.

80
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,490
Some of them are big investors, some are small.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,020
-I see, so those investors give money...
-Yes, they provide money.

82
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,800
So producer plans to make a movie.

83
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,390
Those investors who support the idea
join the Production Committee.

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,650
-So those companies cover production cost...
-They provide risk hedge.

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,800
-Wow... Oh, Dentsu is there!
-Yes it is.

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,030
-But there are no TV stations.
-Dentsu is an investor.

87
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:57,080
So if "The Eternal Zero" will succeed, those 16 companies in Production Committee will get dividends?

88
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,840
Yes. Some covered 30% of costs and some only 1%.

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,280
-So they'll return the money they invested?
-Yes, their shares.

90
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,340
For example, if $1 million, spent for production,
is returned, then it's all good,

91
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,900
because we produced a movie
and no one has lost money.

92
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,320
But if a profit increases, shares also increase.

93
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,410
"Yey, we earned 150% of what we spent!"

94
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,580
So if $1 million was invested,
$1.5 millions return. Isn't this great?

95
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,740
After listening to various people in this show

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,680
I realized that it is hard to make ends meet.

97
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,770
-You sure fuss a lot over payments...
-I recalled the pay talk. It's difficult.

98
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,590
So with those even shares, you don't earn much.

99
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:50,520
For example, if production cost of a movie is $5 millions and P&A is $3 millions, overall is $8 millions.

100
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,790
So to cover expanses of $5 million movie
you need a $20 million Box Office.

101
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,890
-To recoup money from showing movie in theaters...
Do you know what "recoup" means? -No.

102
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,450
Here is a new word for you beside "pay". Recoup.

103
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:08,450
[Recoup]

104
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,940
To recoup means to get invested money back.

105
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,710
-From Production Committee?
-Yes, investors will be happy to get their money back.

106
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,440
-Right, everyone will be happy...
-...to get their money back.

107
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,620
Then there are 2nd and 3rd releases on TV and DVDs.

108
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,720
There it is! A DVD! DVD is awesome, isn't it?

109
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,650
So if you can recoup in movie theaters,
you can fan yourself.

110
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,600
-What does it mean? -To relax.
-Well, it's as simple as that, though...

111
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,230
-Then you simply wait? -No, there is still
a lot of things to do, like releasing DVDs, etc.

112
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,880
-So to recoup a $5 million movie...
-The Box Office must be $20 millions.

113
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:00,800
[End of lesson, back to the main topic]

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,490
I want to make a movie, where should I start?

115
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,680
Wow, I am lost, there is so many things...

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:19,280
-Moreover, a nationwide. -A movie that will promote a Hakata idol group nationwide.

117
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,100
It's difficult...

118
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,600
-If you want a nationwide release...
-Of course.

119
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:40,020
...you need a movie that will interest big
nationwide level distributors like Toho.

120
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,260
And for that you need a good project plan...

121
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,300
-Is it that difficult?
-Yes it is.

122
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,210

123
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:59,100

-Don't involve me.

First of all, what kind of movie did you want to make?

127
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,440
-School drama.
-School with visual effects.

128

-School what?
-Visual effects.

[School drama with visual effects]

131
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,270
I've heard that Yamazaki-san is master of visual effects, so I was hoping he'll film it.

132
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,820
So what exactly is this school effects thing?

133
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,380
With gunfights like in "Matrix".

134
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,590
-Something like that.
-I see...

135
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,030

-Zero interest in work.
-You are really something.

[Money talk isn't over! Many fights still lie ahead!]

162
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,600
-Sashihara-san, we failed to interest him.
-The aim is just too big.

163
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,790
-By the way, my "Pervert Mask" costed $170 000.
-That's very cheap!

164
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,240
-Right?
-Super cheap!

165
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,440
But since it was released somewhat nationwide

166
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:58,500
it was around $500-600 thousands.

167
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,380
-I called one producer who is my big friend and she is in the office right now. -Good, let's go.

168
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,290
-I think she'll help us. She is woman, by the way.
-Ah, that's good.

169
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,440
You probably know her. She's made a
"Handsome Suit" movie... Ah, you don't?

170
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,090
Why you spoke like I may know it?

171
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,770
-A comic Tsukaji Muga starred in it.
-Of course I know him.

172
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,740
It is a comedy. Ah, you don't know it?

173
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,430
It was relatively successful.

174
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,100

-What do you want to eat today?
-Grilled meat.

177
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,310
-Grilled meat?
-I can't tell the difference between meat.

178
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,980
-You should. -I can tell if it's chicken meat,
but pork or beef are difficult. -No way!

179
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,000
They are tasty regardless where you eat.

180
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,600
I'd feel bad for grilled meat if someone like you eat it.

181
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,410
But it's not like I am puzzled about the taste,
everything tastes awesome to me.

182
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,590
-"Wow, so tasty! Was it pork or beef?"
-Something like that.

183
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,880
Since I look happy eating I think the cook is also happy.
So everyone is happy.

184
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,720

185
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,020

-Recently much talked was (movie).
-It was a disaster.

201
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,870
-A disaster indeed.
-Well, it happens with movies.

[Movie is a big disaster if it flops]

203
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:02,350
We've come up with this idea to make a nationwide movie to make HKT more popular...

204
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:09,580
Sorry, but I have a question first.
How much did it cost to produce this movie?

205
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,720
-I thought it's better to start with money talk. -Frankly!

206

[A frank money talk]

207
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,950
-How much did it cost?
-If we're talking about production only...

208
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,210
A movie of this scale is expected to cost around $3.5 millions, but...

209
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,860
-I've reduced it to...
-Oh, an economist!

210
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,990
$2.7 millions.

211
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,390
-Where did it start from?
-It all starts from screenplay.

212
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,370
-A planning starts from script?
-Manabu Makime's scripts are rather complicated,

213
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,150
but as you know, I mainly produce teenage oriented movies based on manga.

214
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,770
So Asmik Ace will start planning based only on script?

215
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:03,120
If we can explain the outline of the movie,
we can gradually gather supporters...

216
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,090
-What supporters?
-Those who'd be willing to invest in production.

217
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,130
-So that's your job?
-Yes.

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,340
It's a producer's job...

219

[Huge pressure]

220
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,930
There's a lot of visual effects in this movie.

221
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,490
Oh, I also want to make a movie with visual effects!

222
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,190
-A school drama with visual effects.
-She wants a school setting and visual effects.

223
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,870
-Starring Sakai Masato.
-But you're a director of "Pervert Mask".

224
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,800
-She wants to get Sakai Masato.
-Yeah, I'll try my best from now on.

225
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,320
-And what is the story?
-Nothing is decided yet.

226
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,270
-Only that it's a school drama with visual effects, Sakai Masato and HKT. -And Sashihara Rino as producer.

227
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,570
You need a scriptwriter that would write a script that would interest Sakai Masato.

228
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,330
Sakai Masato will ask about script.
For him contents are important.

229
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,660
Well, I can write the script,
if he's OK with author of "Pervert Mask".

230
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,240
[Scriptwriter - Fukuda Yuichi?]

231
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,490
I wish you'd write the script faster. You are always late!

232
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,890
Since members aren't experienced in acting,
if the script comes late, they'll say to me:

233
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:23,260
-"Sasshi, I suddenly have to memorize so much text..."
-She's a quite sharp producer.

234
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,710
-Yes, members are all novices... -Since they are not used to acting, they'll be troubled by late script.

235
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,950
"I just got the script, how can I remember so much text?"

236
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,180
So I as producer would have to apologize,
since it was me who chose the scriptwriter.

237
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
That's not good.

238

239
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,480
But there is this interesting aspect
of it being produced by Sashihara Rino

240
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,790
and that it's a HKT movie.

241
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,420

-What else?.. -It's already quite good.
-Yeah, they are local idols,

248
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,170
-so this kind of investors are quite common.
-We received a nice idea!

249
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,080
In contrast to Abe-san's "Show me when it's done".

250
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:42,410
-"You'll be able to make payments with $20 millions".
-Well, yeah, if the cost is $10 millions...

251
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,560
What is the minimum we have to gather?

252
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:50,040
[What's the minimum?]

253
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,310
It's really case-by-case.

254
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,410
On the contrary, if you have a specific audience from who you can get $3 millions Box Office,

255
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,410
then it means that a movie should cost less than $1 million. -Oh, isn't that possible?

256
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,560
It's possible to make budget calculations
based on estimated Box Office.

257
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,010
P&A expenses are usually equal to production expenses.

258
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:20,780
If the movie is low budget,
you can minimize the advertising expanses

259
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,140
by advertising it to only your specific audience.

260
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,960
That way you reduce advertising expanses.

261
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:32,420
But if production cost starts from $2-2.5 millions

262
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,770
and it is released in 200-300 theaters nationwide

263
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,370
the budget usually doubles.

264
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,440
[A great anxiety]

265
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,860
How much did your "Mirror of Muse" cost?

266
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,110
-Beats me.
-Crap, who knows?

267
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,020
-Who could know that? Did it cost $1 million?
-No! It was cheaper!

268
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,490
Then we can do it! I'm OK with something like that.

269
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,270
In that case we can get by
$170 000 budget of "Pervert Mask".

270
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,950
-Is it nationwide release?
-Ah, right, it must be nationwide.

271
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,970
If there was a late night drama beforehand
the title would be already known to public,

272
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,790
-so it could reduce promotion expanses.
-"Yoshihiko"...

273
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,380

"Hero Yoshihiko" movie like that, I know.

-You two are hilarious...
-Within a year...

He's trying to make a
"Hero Yoshihiko" movie within a year.

276
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,640
-I am not.
-Yes, you are!

[End of lesson]

278
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:43,020
If we find a director, persuade Sakai Masato
and gather Production Committee

279
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,750
we'll come back to Yamada-san for further planning.

280
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,780
Right. We'll look for director.

281
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,970
-I'll support you.
-Thank you very much!

282
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,120
-Awesome! There may be hope.
-I'll do my best.

283
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,440
-Thank you.
-You run around with a bomb.

284
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,310
-Who will be the next victim?..
-That's true.

285
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,100
It'll become famous in industry.

286
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,050
"Oh, no! Sashihara came!"

287
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,490
"She'll involve me in some risky talk!"

288
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,860
Sasshi, big news!

289
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,090
It's supposed to be an end of today's shooting,

290
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,620
but Abe-san, we've met not a long ago,

291
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,360
contacted director Yamazaki Takashi.

292
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,730
-He's so kind...
-That's true.

293
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:44,440
-Even though he was so reluctant... -Like "no way!"
He really likes carrot and the stick approach...

294
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,620
So Yamazaki-san agreed to meet us now.

295
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,990
What if we'll talk to him

296
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,330
and he agrees to be a director?

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,140
Is he somewhere near?

298
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,130
No, he's quite far away.

299
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,500
-Long trip awaits us.
-Ah...

300
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,450
-He is a director of "The Eternal Zero".
-Right. Let's do our best!

301
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,060
-Nice development.
-Yes, now we have hope.

Won Best Director and Best Screenplay prizes at the Japanese Academy Awards.
Specializes in visual effects.

303
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,490
So persuasion of Yamazaki-san depends on the skill
of producer Sashihara.

304
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,830
I see. I'll do my best.

305
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,660
What will you say to him?

306
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,870
I will beg him. That's the only thing I can do.

307
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,640
I have neither knowledge, nor power.
Only motivation.

308
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,950
I'll be like part-timer on interview
for a job in convenience store.

309
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,010
-I might lie a say that I've watched "Always".
-You'll lie? -I think it might help.

310
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,780
-There are 3 movies. -I'll say that I haven't watched 3rd yet, so it would sound more real.

311
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,210
I might say, that I haven't watched 3rd yet,
only the first two.

312

[Ready... Fight!]

313
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,840
-Sasshi... -Wow! "Seven Samurai".
-Oh, you know it?

314
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,300
-It was a super wild guess!
Glad I hit the mark. -You did!

315
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,850
-I've heard that it's a studio where Akira Kurosawa worked. -I see...

316
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,600
