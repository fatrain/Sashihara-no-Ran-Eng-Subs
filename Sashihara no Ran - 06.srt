00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,240
-SasshI.
-Yes.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,560
-It's been awhile since this show started.
-Yes.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,000
This show is known to be on the dark side.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,330
Basically 80% of the interesting things
we said have been cut.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:21,270
-We said so much interesting stuff.
-That's why recording took so long every time.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,140
-Even when we say so much...
-They don't use it.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,930
All is removed in post-editing.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,670
You know how they put unedited version
in DVD releases?

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,890
Seriously, please don't make DVD.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,420
It's really don't like it.
During handshake events

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,090
a little girl told me she recorded every episode.

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,880
I thought to myself "Please drop it!"

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,070
-It's better not to let kids watch this show.
-I thought of changing the subject of this show.

14
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:57,656
Sashihara's Rebellion

15
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:04,843
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

16
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:09,601
to challenge several projects,
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,050
But in other words,
we can say this show is talking about dreams.

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,900
Can't we consider it to be pursuing dreams?

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,480
Well you describe it quite positively.
Indeed, it is about pursuing dreams.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:29,490
Yeah, in the process we will have to face
unavoidable reality in the industry.

21
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,450
There will be obstacles such as budget and connections.

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,510
And this show is about, how Sashihara Rino works hard to overcome them towards realizing her dreams.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,660
Yes, dream-realizing variety.

24
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,930
-That's right.
-An amazing show.

25
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,930
-Dream-realizing variety should be a prime time TV show.
-"Achieving your dream" special.

26
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:57,640
Right. It shows youngsters,
that it's possible to overcome obstacles.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,830
I thought... Oh! A window cleaners!

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,240
-We had festival outside during the last recording, and now window cleaning. -Amazing.

29
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,650
-Well, this company has the money for proper cleaning.
-Nice, "East".

30
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,810
Here's an important matter, now that the photo collection is done we have to sell it.

31
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,200
-Release date is set. -Oh?

32
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,310
[Release information]

33
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,110
-When is it?
-December 26.

34
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,320
Ah, much earlier than planned.

35
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,240
Christmas season.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,170
In Aoki-san's mail, he said there were too many good pictures,

37
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,170
so it's decided to increase the number of pages.
-That's great.

38
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,359
[So...]

39
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,359
[Sashihara Rino's first photo collection will be on sale from Dec 26th]

40
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:51,359
[Published by "Koubunsha", only 1500 Yen + tax. Godlike gift you will absolutely want will be enclosed]

41
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,994
[Well, next rebellion]

42
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,380
-At the end of Okinawa, we talked about horse racing.
-Yes let's go, I've been looking forward to it.

43
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,630
We really can't do this, after finding out we are unable to book your schedule for weekends.

44
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,830
Well there are handshake events

45
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,830
-Horse racing is normally held over the weekends.
-Really? Then there is really no chance.

46
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:21,810
-Also, Take Yukata, who you referred as "that dude"...
-My deepest apologies for that.

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,860
-"That dude" Take Yukata basically spends his weekend at the racecourse. -I see.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:37,740
-He is still busy even after horse racing is over on weekends, like on Monday. -I think so, he should be busy.

49
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:45,370
After we came back from Okinawa, Tsukamoto-san and "Ohta Pro" tried to arrange it, but he's busy on weekends.

50
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,890
Why!

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,850
-This is really hard.
-Then I will give up on horse racing.

52
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,100
No choice but to give up.
Nothing can be done if it's schedule's problem.

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:02,240
-So, besides this, what ambition do you want to achieve? -Of course I thought about it.

54
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,820
Make a HKT48 movie!

55
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:09,393
[She wants to make a movie of HKT48]

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,890
But you have no interest in movies.

57
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,750
We know each other for so long and you don't seem to have any interest in movies or dramas.

58
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,050
-If there is a role for me then I will be glad to do it.
That's it. -Something like that.

59
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:28,530
I'm not capable to say "I want to be actress too" in front of those people targeting to be an actress.

60
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,620
So I keep my mouth shut.

61
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:36,100
-Yes, I know you do not have that ability. -Therefore it's better to be silent. I am fine with occasional appearances.

62
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,720
So what I want is a HKT movie without me in it.

63
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,360
-A movie that have all HKT members?
-Yes.

64
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:52,395
[On Nov 2, HKT48 is joined by nine new 3rd gen members.
The second project Sashihara wants to do, is to make a movie with appearances of HKT48 members]

65
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,074
[HKT48: all-out efforts]

66
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,790
-A nationwide release?
-Yes of course! A "Toho"'s release.

67
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,830
"Zaboom! Toho". You know what I am saying?
Waves crashing in intro.

68
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,600
-"Toho" is not the one with crashing waves.
-Who has them then?

69
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,700
-Zaboom is not "Toho". -Then what is it?
-Zaboom is from "Toei".

70
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,960
-Ah, then "Zaboom! Toei".
-You're OK with "Toei"?

71
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,160
-Either one is fine as long as it has "To".
-As long as it has "To"?

72
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,040
-I'm fine with roaring lion too.
-Roaring? Where was it?

73
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,410
-Well, I don't care. -You don't care?
-As long as it's nationwide.

74
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,640
-So any distributor is fine?
-Not those small cinemas.

75
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,190
-Nationwide.
-Boom!

76
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,410
-So nationwide?
-If you have to ask why,

77
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:42,440
currently HKT has only one TV show that is aired in Kanto region if we don't count those in Fukuoka.

78
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,760
Only "HKT48 no Odekake!"

79
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,810
-The one that used to be on in the same time with us, for once, right? -Yes, the one MC'ed by me and Goto-san.

80
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,510
-Ah, no wonder our ratings were horrible that time. -Yeah.

81
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,160
-But this might be a good thing. -Yes I am grateful.

82
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,800
I want to lie low.
If this show's ratings go up I will be troubled.

83
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,000
It's better to stay away from spotlight, because it's scary.

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,840
I wish everyone will watch "HKT48 no Odekake!".

85
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,860
[Love for this show: 0]

86
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,170
Even in the Tohoku and Hokkaido region,
there are fans too, right?

87
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,760
I know it's little but as long as people look forward to us it's fine.

88
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,060
But we can't hold handshake events without enough fans.

89
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,610
But to gain fans HKT still does not have enough promotions going on.

90
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,160
-Ah, right, you are theater manager?
-Yes!

91
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,660
That's why I think a lot about HKT.

92
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,020
-Oh yeah, a manager. -Fans tell me as manager to do more handshake events.

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,950
They hope us to hold
more handshake events in different places.

94
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,746
But we have to cover expanses,
like we discussed earlier.

95
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:54,060
-You have to pay for stuff.
-Yes, do payments.

96
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,600
To cover expenses we need to gather more fans.

97
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,210
But they are not coming to HKT.

98
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,580
Even if we want to hold HS events,
we can't, if nobody comes.

99
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,830
To fix that, we need promotion to attract more customers, which we are lacking of right now.

100
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,160
-I see. You really thought a lot, manager.
-Yes.

101
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,240
I wanted to do a show helpful for people.

102
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,950
-Wonderful!
-I don't want others think "Ah, it's so dirty and vulgar".

103
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,090
So that's why you decided on a movie?

104
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:26,458
[Surprisingly serious]

105
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:36,770
Milky wanted me to tell you this: "I want to be in a movie".

106
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,760
-"I want to be in a movie".
-"I want to be in a movie".

107
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,390
"But I also want Aoki-san
to release my photo collection".

108
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,600
-Another one?
-Yes, another one.

109
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,338
I said "Since you want another one, why not go to someone else?"

110
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,020
"Maybe you can show another side of yourself".

111
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,150
And she is like "No, I'm fine with Aoki-san's photo collection."

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,080
I guess this is why he likes Milky.

113
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,080
But I told her "Aoki-san is not reliable,
he switched to Kojima Mako!"

114
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:12,020
She replied:"It's OK, I believe in him." It felt like a couple in a long relationship. I thought it was wonderful.

115
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:19,874
[Second project is about movie]
[Vulgar topics everywhere]

116
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,771
Miyuki is so cute. I like her very much.

117
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,980
Actually making a movie is no simple feat.

118
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,270
I have utterly no idea, so I need to learn from the basics.

119
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,280
It was also my first time when we did the photo collection, there's not many people involved. -Very few.

120
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,860
If it's making a movie, how many staff will we need?

121
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,450
-Maybe 4 times more?
-Around 40.

122
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,260
Mr. "Summer Nude" keeps his voice soft...

[Cameraman Ono was a part of the filming crew of dramas like "Summer nude"]

124
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,970
-Really, about the required staff...
-Look, they already gathered here.

125
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,560
-There is Ono-san with one camera.
-He'll film?

126
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,860
Here we also have a sound engineer, and that's enough to start filming. Also, a director.

127
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,930
We're good to go!

128
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,980
-Listen... -Lighting.
-I am director? -Yes, director and film crew.

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,050
Well, how to say this, director of my level is not up to par.

130
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,530
That's a lie! I can see through you.
You definitely want to film "Hero Yoshihiko" movie.

131
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,820
You have such an expression!

132
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,570
-Definitely consider making "Hero Yoshihiko movie".
-No-no! -Definitely!

133
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,130
-It seems like you have no idea about my recent works.
-Totally no idea.

134
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,980
-I am working on "Pervert Mask".
-The simplest method is to let Fukuda-san do it.

135
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,710
Bad idea. I am not on nationwide level.

136
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,350
Nobody would want to watch a HKT movie made by the director of "Pervert Mask".

137
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,120
Relax, I won't leave it to you.

138
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,550
-I told you so.
-I won't leave it to you, don't worry.

139

[No to "Pervert Mask"!]

140
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,250
-Why don't you be the director then?
-Nah, I don't want to have a hand in it.

141
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,640
How does "Directed by Sashihara Rino" sounds?

142
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,360
If I still have to continue work at home,
then when am I supposed to rest?

143
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,680
-Director's workload is not that heavy.
-But you still have to work on the script.

144
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,810
Even though I won't appear on screen,
director's job will fill all my schedule.

145
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,810
I will have to be constantly on set
and won't be able to do my other jobs at all!

146
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,750
Not making an appearance when it's supposed
to be my job, yet incredibly busy. It's strange!

147
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,920
-How about producer?
-This is the best one!

148
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,650
[Producer Sashihara]

149
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:46,330
Producer means they climbed up the ladder from AD and director and after various trials they can finally put on airs.

150
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,830
-But I haven't met producers that puts on airs recently.
-Really?

151
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:56,340
-Actually producers have the image of them apologizing.
-But that (producer A)...

152
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,830
Ah, (producer A) is different case...

153
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,840
-During "Kis-My-Ft2" TV recording, you will not see (A) on set unless AKB is making an appearance. -Seriously?
