1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,120
I want to release a photo collection.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,120
Frankly speaking, Sasshi in swimsuit is not in demand.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,870
True.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,810
If I go nude, I am sure there will be people willing to buy it.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,720
It's a place where Aoki-san is sleeping.
Entertainment editorial department.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,330
Hello! It's been a while.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,810
You wanted to talk about something?

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,320
-"Sashihara's Rebellion" is...
Her personal show?

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,330
-Yes, her new show.
-Wow.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,710
The show has started and we are here today,
because Sasshi wants a photo collection.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,160
I want "Koubunsha" to release it.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,520
He looks troubled.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,050
-"Koubunsha's" release.
-A photo collection?

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,140
She wants to release a photo collection.

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,660
By the way, will there be photos in swimsuits too?

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,910
It's going to be like "Santa Fe".

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,520
She is even prepared to go nude.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,720
Though I doubt there is a demand for it.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,970
In a bikini from shells. Who wore it?

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,040
Takeda Kumiko-san.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,860
And in seaweed too of course.

22
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:17,123
Sashihara's Rebellion

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:25,548
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

24
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:29,590
to challenge several projects,
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,270
But you've already released one, right?

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,950
-Photo book.
-Right. It was very good.

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,210
Really? Thank you very much.

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,980
It's really hard to overcome that success.

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,820
-Photo collection?
-Look, his eyes are cold.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,760
-No, no...
-As expected, his eyes don't laugh.

31
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,510
Photo collection? It's a lot of pressure.

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,110
What it's going to be like?

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,210
[What kind of photo collection?]

34
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,030
-Something along the lines of "Hello! Project".
-Like "Hello! Project"?

35
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,900
Yeah.

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,660
-With jumping on the beach?
-Something like that.

37
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,510
-A classic idol photo collection.
-Classic?

38
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,810
Back to the previous talk...

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,340
-Frankly speaking, Sasshi isn't that pretty.
-Not at all!

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,340
And she doesn't...

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,160
-...have boobs.
-Well, yeah...

42
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,820
But we've published photo collections
of all General Election winners.

43
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,790
-Eh?
-Of Acchan and Oshima-san.

44
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,170
-And Sashihara!
-Right.

45
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,070
-Please release it.
-A complete set.

46
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,700
-Is that so?
-Yeah!

47
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
Let's complete the set!

48
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,630
That's a lot of pressure.

49
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,690
So you've released photo collections of all winners?

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,630
Aoki-san, before that...

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,950
I wanted to ask - when Sasshi became 1st,

52
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,620
was "Koubunsha" planning to release her photo collection?

53
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,250
Nope.

54
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,110
-I wonder why?
-I am not sure myself.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,390
Well, you've already released one...

56
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,590
And her becoming 1st raised the hurdle.

57
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,160
-For example budget...
-They chickened out.

58
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,260
What about budget?

59
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,000
[What about budget?]

60
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,920
For example she may request to shoot in Europe, in Paris,

61
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,110
but, frankly speaking,
photo collection budget isn't that big.

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,840
There is no budget for photo collections?

63
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,580
Not as big as TV's.

64
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,970
-Where was Yuko-chan's collection shot?
-In Los Angeles.

65
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,260
Because AKB was already going to Los Angeles,
we took this opportunity.

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,890
Ah, I see, to reduce travel expanses?

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,550
AKB payed for Yuko's one-way ticked
and "Koubunsha" payed for her return.

68
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,100
-I see...
-Split expanses.

69
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,600
What's the approximate budget of this
Oshima Yuko's Los Angeles collection?

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,670
The usual budget for a photo collection is $30 000.

71
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,280
But for overseas shootings it of course increases.

72
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,260
So when a company makes an offer,
it increases to $40 000,

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,770
but in the end... I even payed for myself then.

74
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,350
Only I.

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,480
And I was living in a hotel in the same room with a gay cameraman assistant.

76
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,250
-Funny and sad.
-Because it reduces expanses.

77
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,020
What was Milky's budget?

78
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,240
Milky's was about the same.

79
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,430
There is no way Yuko-chan's and Milky's
budget was the same! Don't lie!

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,770
Ah, right! What was it?

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,260
Pretending he forgot.

82
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,050
Right, we also released a DVD for her.

83
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,260
He said it! "Koubunsha" usually releases DVDs.

84
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,850
We've started to release DVDs
after we released a DVD for Maeda Acchan.

85
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,590
"King Records" was selling Acchan's DVD and since it sold so well,

86
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,590
we received a certificate of gratitude from them.

87
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,520
Is that so?

88
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,140
Since Acchan was such star,

89
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,300
I was preoccupied to prevent accidents like mosquito bites.

90
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,300
There was lots of them, because it was on an island.

91
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,940
So to prevent that, I went to a shooting location 20 min before everyone else

92
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,000
and sprayed out anti-mosquito repellent,
that I brought lots from Japan.

93
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,820
-Aoki-san?
-Yes.

94
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:46,420
But at one place I was spraying repellent,
but nobody came, so I started wondering why.

95
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,910
So I called manager Nakajima, but he said,
that they are shooting at a different place.

96
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,610
Ah, that's terrible! What a waste of repellent!

97
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,640
I sprayed repellent all that time.

98
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,560
-So you do this assistant work?
-Of course.

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,990
So the pride of Acchan's photo collection is that she wasn't bit by mosquitoes even once in 4 days.

100
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,850
-Acchan?
-Acchan.

101
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,800
Akimoto-san won't get angry
even if mosquitoes will bite me.

102
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,070
He won't get angry, even if I was bitten, that's for sure.

103
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,250
If Sasshi is to be bitten, that photo of a bite will become a specialty of a photo collection.

104
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,500
True.

105
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,450
So the profit is higher, if there is DVD?

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,710
If there is DVD the budget also increases.

107
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,140
That's why we managed to go overseas.

108
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,310
Because of combined budget of photo collection and DVD?

109
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,360
Right.

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,990
In AKB's case it is also very hard to schedule.

111
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,890
-I see.
-It was hard.

112
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:56,280
-Sasshi, I got an impression, that he's making excuses.
-About schedules, etc...

113
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,440
-Scary. He's trying to run away.
-It's a sign of rejection.

114
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,030
For example, if you'll say you want to shoot in Spain or Italy...

115
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,910
I won't! I want to shoot in Oita.

116
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,760
-In Oita?
-Yes. I am fine with it.

117
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,740
-I won't say about Europe.
-So no Europe?

118
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,970
-How about Hawaii?
-Hawaii? Well, Okinawa would be nice...

119
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,390
-Okinawa?
-Okinawa should be OK, right?

120
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,500
-Isn't Okinawa on the contrary expensive?
-Okinawa?..

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,830
Wherever is fine with me, seriously.

122
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,590
I am willing to shoot even in "Ohta Pro" office.

123
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,560
I am fine with anything, so just release it.

124
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,020
Please.

125
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,570
Roger.

126
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,660
Did you hear that?

127
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,660
-He said "roger".
-No, it's just my favorite word.

128
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,000
So he indeed said it!

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,190
Ah, thank you very much!

130
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,700
He agreed.

131
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,370
Let's watch it one more time!

132
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,180
I am fine with anything, so just release it.

133
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,370
Please.

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,010
Roger.

135
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,030
Roger.

136
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,120
Roger.

137
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,130
-He said it!
-He agreed!

138
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,680
I heard "roger".

139
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,310
So you just needed to ask.

140
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,720
OK, we'll start preparations.

141
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,520
-I need to make calculations later.
-There we go again...

142
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,100
Please tell us what calculations you'll make.

143
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,500
Because this show is about,

144
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,540
how I survive in the bog of show business.

145
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,960
I want to know this stuff.

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,710
I need to make sure it'll sell, so it won't spoil your image, since you're 1st now.

147
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,820
-If it won't sell, i'll become a laughingstock.
-It's a minus. I see.

148
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:54,250
-Who'll laugh at you?
-My colleagues magazine editors, "Shuueisha"'s Kondo...

149
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,810
(some publisher)

150
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,630
They will surely giggle, when we meet.

151
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,190
They both have nasty characters.

152
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,930
Ah, Kondo-kun is OK.

153
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,360
They'll tease you?

154
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,020
They have a stance of selling 100 000 copies.

155
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,210
But I'd like to release photo books of all AKB girls,
even if I steadily sell only 10 000 copies.

156
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:16,420
That's lovely.

157
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,580
Interesting.

158
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,940
I don't need money. It's not about money,
but rather sustaining Sasshi's reputation.

159
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,080
But if we're in the red, company won't approve this plan.

160
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,380
-So let's ask "Koubunsha" then?..
-Please help us.

161
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,490
-Sasshi, do you agree on Okinawa?
-Yes. I love Japan.

162
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,840
Okinawa then?

163
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:46,682
Photographing is in Okinawa.

164
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,090
Let's make it pleasing to everybody.

165
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,900
Photographer must be famous.

166
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,523
[Photographer]

167
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:16,020
Do you know how much (famous photographer) gets for 1 photo?

168
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,260
A lot.

169
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,990
$1000 for 1 photo.

170
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,320
$1000 for 1 photo.

171
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,700
-1 photo?
-So $5000 for 5 photos.

172
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,330
How many pages are there in collection?

173
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:34,430
In collection?.. Well, if it's a whole collection, then it's about 10% off.

174
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,620
Otherwise, the budget will get bigger and bigger.

175
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,990
How I envy (famous photographer)...

176
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,090
We won't get such budget.

177
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,860
Who do you think is good?

178
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,520
I think someone, who already photographed you and who you get along with.

179
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,010
Someone whose photos you like would be the best.

180
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,780
I've decided!

181
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,770
I choose photographer who is "in" right now.

182
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:08,980
He took a really good care of me and he is "in" now.

183
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,960
-Do you know Kuwajima-san?
-No.

184
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,469
He photographed me a lot
and he is pretty famous right now.

185
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,470
He is.

186
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,170
Let's shoot a "Private Life".

187
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,500
Do you know, that he is the one who shot "Private Life" photo collection.

188
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,203
Adachi Yumi's.

189
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:37,834
Photographer Kuwajima Tomoki.
Took a really good care of Sashihara before.
Shoots a lot of photo collections including AKB48.
He's "Private Life" PB is "in" right now.

190
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:47,920
So it's time to find out, what will be our budget for this photo collection.

191
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,000
[How much they'll give?]

192
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,360
Photograph gets an advance payment and a royalty.

193
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,490
He gets royalty if Sasshi's collection will sell good.

194
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:11,380
His fee in advance is $3000 and royalty is 1-2%.

195
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:19,140
-So his fee is a part of budget, right?
-Of course.

196
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:28,810
And there is also a royalty, unknown in the beginning. If collection won't sell then "sorry, pal, no royalty".

197
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:34,930
Sorry, pal... So what will be the overall budget,
if I decide to release a photo collection?

198
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,850
Overall?.. If we add DVD...

199
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:45,240
-Usually $30-40k for photo collection + $20k for DVD.
-Am I the only one who is amazed by these numbers?

200
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,700
-You also have to buy clothes...
-I don't really get this money talk.

201
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Me neither.

202
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,780
-But you film dramas.
-I have no idea about money.

203
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,331
-Is that so?
-Yes.

204
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,600
-What are you doing then?
-I'm the most stupid director in the world.

205
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,330
-There is also fees of other people.
-Whose?

206
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,520
Stylist, makeup artist and the rest, who'll come.

207
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:13,390
And of course clothes.
Clothes usually cost around $3000.

208
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,970
Sasshi said she doesn't need clothes this time.

209
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,650
You can turn that excess to royalty.

210
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,480
How much does it cost to make a photo collection of gravure idol?

211
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,270
Around $30 000.

212
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,910
But it's different with AKB.

213
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,230
Because they sell at least 50 000 copies.

214
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,770
-Will Sasshi sell 50 000 copies?
-I think she will.

215
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,750
I think I won't...

216
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,420
Won't?

217
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,490
Well, photo book is regarded as book, because it has text.

218
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,280
Not entirely though. But photo collections are sold in their own corner.

219
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,750
Photo books sell better, because they lie in book department.

220
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:08,290
But photo collections lie in photo collection corner, which is visited only by those, who wants to buy a collection.

221
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,010
-Ah, I see...
-So if I won't sell at least 15 000 copies like with photo book,

222
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,010
Sasshi will blame me and this will brake my heart.

223
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,400
I won't blame you.

224
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:27,470
-If we sell 50 000 copies, we'll recover budget?
-Of course, if 50 000 copies will be sold...

225
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,930
-We'll be able to cover expanses and photographer...
-Will get his royalty.

226
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,570
50 000 copies...

227
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,930
How much should we pay Kuwajima-san from budget?

228
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,990
Let's write it down, because it can't be leaked.

229
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,320
It must be bleeped out by all means.

230
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:54,480
[Communicating in writing]

231
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,420
If 50 000 copies are sold, how much royalty he'll get?

232
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,830
Royalty and overall, how much we must pay him.

233
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,830
Very straightforward...

234
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,000
It can be seen! Aoki-san,
your confidential correspondence is too lax!

235
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,080
-It's not confidential like that.
-Oops, it's a script.

236
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:18,760
Geez, there is too much, that shouldn't be seen!
This time it's a script...

237
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,810
Confidential correspondence is so lax.

238
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:32,730
-Frankly speaking, usually for Kuwajima-san's class...
-Is this for real?!

239
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,780
No wonder (X) have fallen in love with him,
when she heard it.

240
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:47,820
-So this plus royalty...
-If it sells like previous photo book, then royalty...

241
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,310
50k is our goal. Keeping in mind this goal...

242
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,000
-Look at his money calculation speed!
-He sure is fast!

243
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,530
He's definitely not simpleton,
if he's so good at calculating money.

244
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:11,730
If it sells this much,
Kuwajima-san will probably be happy.

245
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,600
I'll take this paper with me.

246
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,160
I'll present it to him.

247
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,980
This is royalty. But if it sells only 20 000 copies...

248
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,960
-He'll be sad.
-That's sad.

249
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,870
-What if it was ordinary gravure?
-In that case...

250
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:45,660
Because of that, in advance
"I'd pay this much to you, OK?".

251
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,020
-Ah, it's higher if in advance?
-Yes.

252
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,440
-So called "Pay in advance".
-I see, the fee without royalty?

253
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,660
So DVD sales don't matter?

254
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,810
DVD isn't photographer's business.

255
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,560
"Koubunsha" don't deal with DVDs,
so "Koubunsha" don't got so much money.

256
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,510
-Who sells DVDs then?
-Record companies deal with DVDs...

257
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,610
Frankly speaking,
the percentage of (company A) is high, so...

258
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,860
Please share more details.

259
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,725
-We get it.
-Who, Aoki-san?

260
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:26,830
Well, it's used to cover AKB royalty and production expanses,

261
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,590
but even if the percentage of (company B)
is lower, it advertises better.

262
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,870
Ah, I am puzzled now, don't know what to do!

263
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,350
-I am puzzled. I'll leave it to you, because I have no idea.
-It's only natural.

264
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,040
-Aoki-san is amazing!
-So you'll decide what company to choose?

265
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,880
Of course, after discussing with office.

266
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,050
-Aoki-san is a real professional.
-Yeah, very cool.

267
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,660
I though he's just an old man, knowledgeable about AKB.

268
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,440
I've told you that I saw through his black eyes from the very beginning!

269
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,750
Black eyes?.. This means that they shine?

270
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,030
Awesome! Please tear out this sheet of paper.

271
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,250
-I hope Kuwajima-san will accept this fee.
-Me too.

272
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,280
By the way, are you in business?

273
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,710
I mean, in what class you'll fly - business or economy?

274
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,380
I? I always fly in economy class.

275
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,200
Don't worry about it.

276
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,750
Don't worry, I always fly in economy class.

277
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,780
That's a huge difference.

278
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:33,831
Is that so?

279
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,110
Business class is expensive.

280
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
It sure is.

281
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,850
-If Kuwajima-san will request business class...
-Right! We need to ask that!

282
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,640
-Write that down!
-We'll ask that.

283
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,350
Maybe Fukuda-san will request business...

284
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,890
He'll fly in economy, no worries.

285
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,700
Business is fine, if he'll pay for it himself...

286
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,870
-Himself?
-It's OK to pay from own pocket.

287
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,430
We're all fine with economy class here,
please don't worry.

288
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,560
That's a whole different story, I am relieved.

289
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,930
Looks like the economy tickets have sealed the final deal.

290
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,700
Economy class is OK. I am an economic idol.

291
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:19,147
[The end of negotiations]

292
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,500
-The fans should be happy...
-Yes, that's the top priority!

293
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,770
Right, a photo collection, that will make fans and Sasshi happy.

294
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:33,891
So it won't be embarrassing.

295
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,670
Please make fans happy.

Roger.

297
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,020
-Can you promote it?
-Of course I'll write a lot about it in blog and Google+.

298
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,540
Please do.

299
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,040
-You did it, Sasshi. You only had to ask.
-Ikebukuro is worth a visit.

300
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,740
-Yeah, there's no harm in asking.
-Lucky.

301
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,780
-Thanks a lot.
-Roger.

302
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,380
We've progressed quite a bit in a day.

303
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,970
What will we do if Kuwajima-san won't agree?

304
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,610
I'll photograph myself.

305
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,050
It can't be helped.

306
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,860
-So should I photograph?
-Please do, if he'll reject.

307
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:14,900
[On the way to the meeting with photograph Kuwajima]

308
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,970
We've been trying to call Kuwajima-san...

309
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,410
And we got through!

310
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,000
Since his home is nearby, we're going to meet in a cafe near his place.

311
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,630
Hm, where was he living?

312
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,490
-So we're heading that way.
-Thank you! I am glad.

313
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,470
I got so tired after a whole day of
money and face-to-face talking.

314
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,670
I've never done things like that before.

315
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,850
But the most severe money talk is still ahead.

316
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,480
I don't want to! I know nothing about money.

317
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:55,870
The hardest part lies ahead. We'll have to recruit the staff and negotiate their fees.

318
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,340
Ugh, so tough...

319
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,340
It once again crossed my mind -

320
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,530
a photo collection is made by effort of various people
and I am really thankful for that.

321
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,530
And it costs around $50-60 thousands!

322
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,240
That's quite a lot of money.

323
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,240
So I wonder if all photo collections
I've seen so far cost this much...

324
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,950
-Incredible, right?
-That never crossed my mind.

325
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:30,360
When such amount of money is at stake, it's not as simple as "I want one. -There you go" anymore.

326
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,980
The money is scary... Everything in this world is moved by money.

327
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,610
Everyone in this car is here
because they get payed, right?

328
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,610
-Though they don't get that much.
-Is that so?

329
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,420
Yeah, this show is pretty cheap.

330
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,700
Is that so? Then I am relieved.

331
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,660
That's good.

332
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,330
But it seems like we'll seal the deal.

333
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,420
-Yes, it's great, that Aoki-san was so nice.
-He was very cooperative.

334
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:05,820
-He wasn't your hater.
-That's a relief.

335
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,880
-He wasn't your fan though.
-I'm just not his type. I am glad he is neutral to me.

336
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:17,350
It's better than to be hated. But it is often said, that it's better to be loved or hated, than being ordinary.

337
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,350
But I changed my mind, neutral is the best.

338
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,230
-You've changed your mind?
-Being neutral is the best.

339
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,260
Wow, you've reached the enlightenment.

340
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,820
I think being loved by anyone can be bothersome too.

341
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,990
Neutral is the best.

342
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,399
[Now to the battle!]

343
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,810
Looks like Kuwajima-san is waiting us here.

344
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,010
How does he look like?

345
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,720
He has bleached hair, with black roots.

346
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,170
He's here.

347
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,030
Hello!

348
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,420
Good evening.

349
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,820
Good evening. It's been awhile.

350
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,320
-Sorry for calling you out here.
-No worries.

351
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,040
-I am Fukuda. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

352
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,540
So what did you want to ask?

353
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,340
-It's about that photo collection of yours.
-What?

354
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,000
-A famous now "Private Life".
-Ah, that one...

355
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
I was wondering if it's OK to mention it.

356
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,440
-It might be edited out, if I'd mention it.
-She told me about your situation just now.

357
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,940
-What's going on now? Are you dating?
-Who knows?.. I'll leave it to your imagination.

358
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,980
He's the person, who made that famous photo collection.

359
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,510
-Shouldn't we give him a mic?
-Right!

360
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,260
I don't have a mic.

361
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,430
-Should we order something?
-Yes, you are right.
