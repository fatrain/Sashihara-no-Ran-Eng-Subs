00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,580
I want to make HKT movie!

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,500
What should we do?

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,910
Even if you have a plan, don't call me!

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,770
Where to get money?

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,590
So that's your job?

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,630
Yes. It's a producer's job...

7
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:20,830
[Among that]

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,880
-Nice to meet you, director!
-She acts like we know each other...

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,220
-Sorry! -Like we've already worked together.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,620
I've imitated the tension like we met a couple of times already. Thanks a lot for having us.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,250
-Since you've agreed to meet us, this means you agreed for this job. -That's the setting. -I agreed?

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,990
That's why called you a director.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,970
-I've already think of you
as our movie director. -Ah, I see...

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,300
She acts as producer right now.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
You've filmed a lot of famous stuff, right?

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,310
Looks like she heard it from someone.

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,760
-No, no...
-For example, "Always"...

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,630
I saw it, I saw it...

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,450
She definitely hasn't seen it.

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,210
You should look in the eyes,

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,980
when you talk to people!

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,090
I love movies very much.

23
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:12,863
Sashihara's Rebellion

24
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:19,850
"Sashihara's Rebellion" is a show in which Sashihara Rino works with all kinds of professionals

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,154
to challenge several projects,
while traveling and messing around everywhere.

26
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,040
-She wants to make a movie with visual effects.
-Visual effects? -Yes!

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,320
She always says that.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,980
Please explain.

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:44,510
Well, the director, if possible, is Zakiyama-san.

30
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,850
Zakiyama-san is a director.
Scriptwriter is Mitani Koki-san.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,260
And actors are HKT members and Sakai Masato-san. That's my ideal.

32
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,550
The budget should be low. Around $150 000.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,290
-And visual effects?
-Yes! School drama with visual effects.

34
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,230
-School drama with visual effects?
-Yes! School VFX.

35
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:14,540
-What kind of visual effects?
-Something like dodging from bullets.

36
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:19,840
[In hope of Matrix]

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,170
The budget is pretty tight... Why only $150 000?

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,360
Because I have no power to gather money.

39
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,550
A Production Committee must be created, right?

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,450
A movie with $150 000 budget
probably won't have much advertising power.

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,540
It'll get screened unnoticed by masses.

42
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,710
-Well, I'll somehow gather the money.
-How much?

43
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,760
What should we do?.. On the contrary, what was the budget of your latest work?

44
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,080
-"The Eternal Zero".
-Ah, right.

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,850
-"The Eternal Zero"...
-How much?

46
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,960
If we sum everything up, more than $10 millions.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Why movie makers always use millions?

48
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,810
-It's numeral.
-So it also costed millions?

49
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,880
If there would be $3 millions, we could go with 100 cuts.

50
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,880
-I was also thinking about visual effects at sea.
-The cost of visual effects skyrocketed just now...

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
What about river?

52
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,170
Doesn't matter if it's a river.

53
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,740
-The sea is expensive?
-Yes. -Is it?

54
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,960
-There were lots of visual effects in "Harry Potter", right?
-Yes. - It must be very expensive then?

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Of course! It's a top class movie.
Of course it's expensive.

56
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,420
What is the most expensive movie in the world?

57
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,300
[Big budget movie]

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,810
"Avatar"?

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,020
"Avatar" is also one of the biggest ones.
It costed more than $200 millions.

60
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,500
-To produce only? -Yes.
["Avatar's" production cost: $237 millions]

61
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,060
["Avatar's" production cost: $237 millions]

62
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,500
Well, that to be expected from Hollywood...

63
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,180
I want to make a Hollywood-style movie too!

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,430
Hollywood is not an excuse!

65
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,490
-On $150 000?..
-I want to make a Hollywood class movie!

66
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,040
-Similar to Hollywood?
-Not similar! Hollywood-style!

67
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:15,160
Hollywood-style needs a Hollywood budget.
How much money can you collect?

68
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,410
-Movies are terrific. -Yeah.
-You can't make light of them...

69
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,160
[The scale is too big]

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,260
If there is international market, you could pay employees even with hundreds of millions production cost.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,140
-Oh, it's "pay" again!
-Pay!

72
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,960
-Recoup.
Oh, and a recoup, I've learned about recently!

73
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,590
It's how much profit you have to make
to cover costs, right?

74
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,380
If you won't recoup,
you can't continue making movies.

75
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,850
So recoup is a must.

76
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,560
If production cost is $3 millions, you need a Box Office of $12 millions. That's roughly 1.5 million theater-goers.

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,410
If production cost is $3 millions you need
$12 millions Box Office to recoup?

78
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,550
-Argh, thinking how to return money right away!
-Those are basics!

79
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,620
-Recoup this recoup that!
-I film movies with money in mind.

80
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,330
You have to keep recoup in mind,
so we need 1.5 million theater-goers...

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Sorry if this may be rude, but have you ever made a movie that didn't recoup? Like (movie).

82
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,310
-Everyone is surprised.
-Everyone has jerked just now!

83
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,220
Everyone is like "crap!"

84
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,280
Don't say those things.
Everybody have their ups and downs.

85
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,820
Yeah, shit happens.

86
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,593
[Sorry about that]

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,610
-So, can we look forward to our collaboration?
-If 3 and 12 millions...

88
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,060
Sakai-san is a lead actor and Mitani-san is a scriptwriter.

89
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,650
On the contrary, can she gather money on the basis

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,460
that you might be a director?

91
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,200
Like I said, a script from Mitani-san 
and consent of Sakai-kun are prerequisites.

92
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,780
-So that goes first? -Of course!
Those are the main requirements.

93
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,280
In that case I have confidence in $12 millions Box Office.

94
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,920
-Wow! -It's a school story, right? -Yes.
-What kind? A youth drama?

95
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,400
When you go "Woah!". A suspense.
With blood flying in 3D.

96
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,010
[Suspense horror?]

97
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,660
-Horror?
-Yes, suspense.

98
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,040
-$3 millions for horror is a waste of money.
-Why?

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,930
-A revenue of horrors is limited in general.
It's a niche genre. -Horror is a bad idea?

100
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,680
Isn't is better not to make horror?

101
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,890
What genre is the most popular now?

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,500
Let me think...

103
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,538
Sweets!

104
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,990
Boy and girl come across each other, shyly fall in love,

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,430
but one of them dies in the end.

106
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:53,120
-Sweets, I see... Girls' oriented. With terminal illness.
-Yes, and death because of it.

107
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:57,460
[Love route]

108
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,450
A student falls in love with teacher,

109
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,380
but he is reluctant at first,
because he is a teacher.

110
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:14,320
And when it seems that it's going to work out because of graduation, the illness spoils their happiness. -I see...

111
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:21,230
-But there are no visual effects! -The moment when they fall in love will be with visual effects.

112
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,760
-This will become a hot topic. -Interesting.
-Feels like it's going to work out.

113
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Is there a member who is good at acting and can create this prohibited love atmosphere with Sakai-san?

114
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,650
-Well, some members know a bit about acting.
-Just knowing is not enough.

115
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,430
I can't really tell that they are good
actors looking into your eyes, sorry.

116
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,520
And they need to be rather cute
so the viewers would empathize.

117
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,600
But kids are from Fukuoka.

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,350
They have this cuteness of country-bumpkins that will make viewers empathize.

119
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,860
-Fukuoka's school is a good setting.
-Somehow things progress smoothly... -Yeah...

120
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,430
-What about dialect?
-There is! Words ending with "-chan".

121
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:15,840
-For example, "I love you, teacher".
-Oh, "I love you, teacher" could be a title.

122
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,860
A straightforward title is good.
This could work out.

123
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,920
We might even not need $3 millions,
as there are no visual effects.

124
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,640
-$2 millions for production, so $8 millions Box Office.
It'll work out! -Eh, no way!

-Why so positive?! -Wow!
-So kind!

126
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,420
-This project could become a gold mine.
-Awesome!

127
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,290
$8 millions Box Office to recoup $2 millions...

128
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,350
Sakai-san... Can he be replaced by someone else?

129
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,360
-Of course...
-Those are basics!

130
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,250
Without this condition things will progress right away!

131
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,180
Isn't this great?

132
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,890
If I was to get a big role in "Hanzawa Naoki" drama,
would I have a break as an actress?

133
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,020
-I don't think so.
-Nope.

134
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,260
It's not enough? I have to be a leading actress?

135
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:06,230
It's more like there is no spotlight for actresses.
It's a sweaty battle between men.

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,950
-You know about him?
-Yes.

-You don't know who is that guy?
-Of course not.

-It made you a little happy, right?

-Yamazaki-san watched my "Hero Yoshihiko".
-Is that so?

167
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,860
I said that if he makes a "Yoshihiko" movie, I'll make VFX for it, but somehow he isn't making it.

I was prepared to flee, didn't understand what's going on.

-It's not what I meant.

-"I want to film it! -Yeah, let's film it quickly!"

-Ah, "Sea Monkeys"!
-It wasn't Yamazaki-san who directed it.

Yes. After realizing a photo collection project in this show

197
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,310
it was a rather pleasant start.
And a setback right away on the second project.

198
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,390
This show is about realization of projects.

199
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,230
I've learned that I shouldn't film movies so carelessly too.

200
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,880
-Right! We got a valuable knowledge. You should think about budget from now on. -Yes.

-Today is a steak house. -Super!

208
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,500
And you know why?

209
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,760
You probably don't realize why. In movie arc...

210
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,260
In movie arc where our dreams were scattered.

211
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,500
We were always talking in the car between locations.

212
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,450
At that time you said you liked grilled meat.

213
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:43,190
And when I asked you what meat you like,
you said that it doesn't matter to you.

214
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,440
-For me any meat is tasty. -Yeah, that's what you said.
That you can't tell apart pork from beef.

215
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,940
Yes, everything is yummy to me.
It's not like I try to guess the sort of meat,

216
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,080
I just the tastiness overwhelms me!

217
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,320
-In a positive way.
-Well yeah, you can call it positive.

-I can't tell the difference between meat.
-But you should.

220
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,780
I can tell if it's chicken meat,
but pork or beef are difficult.

221
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,020
They are all tasty.
It's not like I am puzzled about the taste,

222

everything tastes awesome to me!

223
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,320
-"Wow, so tasty! Was it pork or beef?"
-Something like that.

224
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,580
Since I look happy eating, I think the cook is also happy.
So everyone is happy.

225
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,230
I may be soft on directing,
but I am strict about meat.

-I won't forgive those who say,
that anything is tasty. -Sorry!

227
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,450

I said that I'd like to let you know

229
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:56,510
And when it was proposed,
that we go to a steak house then, I agreed.

-You know, I go to steak houses quite often!
-Yeah, I though so,

"UpsetMilky" my ass!
What are you saying, geez?

320
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:15,600
After the flame about Rock-paper-scissors cover
and upsetMilky incident

321
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,240
there was an "Aoki-san's support thread" made.

322
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,560
-On 2channel?
-Yes. -Really?!

323
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,770
"A support thread for currently upsetMilky Aoki".

324
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,060
-Is this true?!
-It had about 49 comments.

325
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,330
-And then stopped? - Yes.
-Ah, not much.

326
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,020
-But the fact that he got a thread is amazing! -Agree!

327
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,960
Aoi-tan and Aoki-tan.

328
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,090
His name is Aoi-tan.

329
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,800
I love this name. There is Motomura Aoi-tan in HKT.

330
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,910
He is big wig in "Koubunsha",
but also an idol fan.

331
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,880
I'd say I am an AKB supporter.

332
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:10,060
-The other day he send me "I have only one favourite member left - Sasshi" via LINE. -Huh?

333
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,500
Look what I am wearing today. "Sashihara love".

334
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,680
That's why you have problems with wife.

335
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,240
[Meat grilling]

336
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,980
-Is this a tongue? -Yes.
-Looks good.

337
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,410
You won't be able to eat other tongues
after you taste this one.

338
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,340
Another special guest...

339
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,220
-Arrived?
-Yes.

340
00:23:41,674 --> 00:23:43,240
[2nd special guest]

341
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,770
I think you'll like this guest.

342
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,970
Really? I don't expect much, because I've already waited for "Berryz Koubou" and look who came...

343
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,150
-Honestly speaking,
I am happy myself about this guest. -Really?

344
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:59,750
-I anticipated this meeting.
-Is it a man or a woman? -A woman!

345
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,000
-Who could it be?
-I think she'll liven up the mood.

346
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,390
-Am I close to her?
-I have no idea about your internal affairs.

347
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,080
-Internal affairs?!
-Yes, but it's not Kojiharu.

348
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,010
There is no way Kojiharu-san would come to this show.

349
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,370
-I think you'll be happy seeing this guest.
-I am not expecting much anymore.

350
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,240
I think she'll make viewers happy too.

351
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,360
Fukuda-san!
